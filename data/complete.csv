ELI5: Does the force between 2 charges change due to a wall between them?," I am coming from a background in Thermal/CFD engineering (modeling) and am a novice at electric and magnetic fields and related subjects. So this may be a very basic or obvious question but I am not able to figure it out. Any explanation/guidance would be greatly appreciated. I am trying to figure out if my understanding is correct from my studies and clarify a few points. 

\[Imgur\]([https://i.imgur.com/ycMAFAq.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/ycMAFAq.jpg))

Consider 2 points at A and B with charges Q at each of them. Let the distance between them be 'r'. Let us assume there is no medium between them.

**Figure\_i questions**

a) Is the force on the charge at B calculated by coulomb law?

b) Am I correct in my understanding that electric field 'E' at point\_B is equal to the displacement field D (which would be equal to electric flux density)? (note:I am not sure if this depends on the charge at B so let us assume there is no charge at B)

**Figure\_ii questions**

Now, if a conducting wall of thickness 't' and infinite length is placed in between the 2 charges. c) Is the 'net' electric field inside the wall is zero?

d) Am I correct in understanding that the electric displacement field 'D' at point B is same at that in Figure\_i?

e) Is the force and electric field E on the charge at B be the same or different from Figure\_i? If the field E is different how to calculate it and will it depend on the relative position of the wall (i.e. nearer to point A OR nearer to point B)?

**Figure\_iii questions**

Now let us consider the wall from figure\_ii is replaced by a dielectric wall of the same thickness 't' and of infinite length.

f) Am I correct in understanding that now there is a 'net' electric field inside the wall given by

ELI5 why do people automatically dismiss the idea of using small scale thorium reactors as a clean energy source?,"I‚Äôm not super well versed on nuclear energy production. I am however a generator technician who is currently doing an electrical engineering degree. One of the issues we discussed so far is the issue of storing capacity for batteries in regards to the use of solar and wind. My professor briefly brought up the efficiency and safety regarding thorium reactors but we had to move on.

So I‚Äôm genuinely curious since I live in a relatively conservative area where climate change gets brushed off and I have never really cared about it until I saw the cost (financially, ecologically, and efficiency) of using coal or gas as an energy source. 

I am not a climate change denialist, but I (from what I‚Äôve learned so far) am not convinced that solar/wind can be the end all be all for energy production in the near future. There seem to be too high a cost on the environment regarding the mining of minerals for batteries, the lifetime and reusability don‚Äôt seem to be very optimistic, and the amount of thorium required to run a small power plant that can power a whole region seems to be exponentially more viable in the foreseeable.

ELI5: How does American college work?,"As a Brit, my entire understanding of US college/University is from media, which is terrible.

In the UK, you typically attend a secondary school from 11-16; a sixth form college between 17 and 18, and then go to university to study a designated single subject for 3 to 4 years. (History, Biomedicine, Civil Engineering etc.) 

It looks as though a different system is available in the US, whereby you get to choose a wide variety of modules in different subjects for the first two years before choosing a major and minor in your final year?

I understand that there are American universities as well that offer single subject studies, but if that is the case then what is the difference between them and the aforementioned colleges? It seems to me as though the major/minor system is geared to produce a more rounded education, but would lack the expertise and specialisation that three years of continuous study would provide.

probability of chemicals coming randomly together and creating life is less than 10^-###.

probability of getting hit by lightning is 1 in ## million.
did they actually count all people out there * number of hours they're outdoor / surface area, and then they counted how many lightning-strike cases are there per year?
did they calculate the surface area covered by clouds, and divide the number of lightning strikes by the area?

Probability of a bullet going through your body and not damaging any major organs is ####?
Did they calculate possible trajectories?

How did they estimate the number of atoms in the universe to be around 10^80. Doesnt sound big enough to me. Avogadro's number is around 10^23 (the number of atoms in 1 mol of a subsrance)
~10^80/~10^23 is ~10^57


I have decent understanding of the mathematics of probability and statistics (i'd better do. i have a phd in engineering). but i dont understand sometimes particular implementations.
to me, it makes sense that probability can be observed empirically, either discrete or continuous

anyone who has dipped a toe in machine learning has come across many naive assumptions (e.g. assume events are independent)

I've seen a train pass us in the opposite direction, so I guess there isn't a physical blockage of traffic on the tracks.

I am a first year computer engineering student, and in my physics class we talked about angular variables, like angular displacement, angular velocity, angular acceleration and so on. We did not talk about momentum though, so be aware of that.

First of all, I know that you can define an infinitesimal angular displacement as a vector. I also know that to prove that something is a vector, you have to demonstrate that it follows the commutative property A+B=B+A, and that it has a direction and a magnitude.

Now my question is: why demonstrating that A+B=B+A is crucial? Isn't this property true for a scalar too?
Does it have to be true because otherwise we can't say it is a vector?

What's more, if a vector needs a direction to be defined, what is the direction of an infinitesimal angular displacement? Is it perpendicular to the plane like angular velocity, since it is the derivative of the angle displacement in function of time? Because if time is a scalar always positive, omega has to have the same direction of the infinitesimal angular displacement. Or am I wrong?

eli5: Why is it still possible to steal cars nowadays?,"Hi there,

I am having a discussion with a friend and we reached a stall as we disagree on some points and neither of us have the technical knowledge to prove their point.

The main question we have is: why is it that with modern cryptography and cybersecurity tech, no car manufacturer has yet implemented a way to prevent people from starting a car without some original (and irreplaceable) key (virtual or physical) connected to the owner? 

My friend's theory is that it would be possible to place the engine under the control of some sophisticated processor that stops it from being activated in absence of the right ""credentials"". Note: we are both aware of the fact that modern wireless car keys can be easily hijacked by capturing the signal as their design is currently flawed, we are talking about a case where the key's signature can't be cloned.

My theory is that if a thief gains physical access to the engine, it's relatively easy to physically hijack it and start the car even if the car's system is protected by some sophisticated cryptography - hence, there is no convenience for car's manufacturers to try to prevent car thefts in such a way.

ELI5: Why don‚Äôt commercial planes have massive emergency parachutes on them that would create enough drag to reduce to manageable speeds during catastrophic failures?,"So I have a flight coming up, and like always, I think of the worst case scenario. And then I ran down the rabbit hole of, ‚Äúhow haven‚Äôt we mitigated this risk yet?‚Äù. The first thing I thought of was parachutes for the passengers, and then I realized that would never in a million years be a practical route. You can probably think of 10 reasons why on your own. 

Then I said, ‚Äúwhy not just put a parachute on the whole plane, or better yet a series of deploying parachutes that deploy when rapidly descending beyond correction.‚Äù When I say this I mean, a first parachute, possibly that allows some sort of air flow through it, so that a stop isn‚Äôt so sudden it kills everyone aboard/becomes a detriment to the planes dexterity. Followed by a series of parachutes, each creating more drag than the last, eventually allowing the plane to level out through speed reduction, or slowly bringing it to a stop safely on the earths surface. I know this would require structural changes like a stronger frame with reinforced anchor points, tons of electronic detection devices and fail safes, and engineering involving the combustibles that would eject the parachutes, but why can‚Äôt this be done. 

I assume it‚Äôs been thought of before, because it seems like a stupidly weird solution, but what is the actual reason that it couldn‚Äôt be engineered? It‚Äôs like if the concept of a drag car ejecting a parachute to reduce speeds after the quarter mile, and all the formulas involved in creating personal use parachutes had a baby.

So from what I understand, you have a fluid that's liquid at really high P, and then you suddenly reduce the P so the liquid evaporates, absorbs heat and therefore makes things cooler.

This is bonkers to me. In my mind a gaseous fluid is at a higher temp than a liquid, so shouldn't the energy in the gas trannsfer to the environment, thereby making things warmer?

How can someone do a bachelor's degree in one subject, then go on to do an extra year or two and get a masters in something different? 
For example, do a bachelor's in engineering, then do a master's in project management or business... Is the entry requirement for a masters only that you've proven yourself capable of working at bachelor's level?

How can this work? The way I see it, you're spending 4 years doing something to a certain level, then an extra one/two years to do something different to a higher level?? So essentially a more respected qualification(masters) in a quarter or a half of the time of a bachelor's...

How far can you push the limits of this? Could you, for example, do a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering, then do a master's in accounting? Or does there have to be some correlation between the two subjects?

Furthermore, once you do one masters, say in accounting, can you then do a second masters in something like project management?

However, I'm curious about how the networks underlying these methods are constructed and function on an engineering level. That is, given that they are ostensibly computer networks:

1. What protocols do they use to communicate?  
2. How do these protocols relate to the Internet Protocol suite? 
3. Are the networks connected to the public internet? 
4. How do different networks (e.g. VISA's network and Mastercard's network) exchange data, given that they likely use different, incompatible protocols (i.e. they're not all using TCP/IP). 
5. Who owns the wires underlying the networks? 
6. Who writes the software that runs the network?

Given the ubiquity of these systems, I feel as if their engineering underpinnings are completely unexplained relative to other parts of society.

How to get Nicotine to work as a stimulant?,"It's FINALS SZN! I'm trying to get the most out of my stimulants since I've been and will be pulling all nighters from Sunday night to Thursday Morning (Strategic naps are key). Morale is pretty low right now, and stimulants always help in these high stress, high absorption of large volumes of information situations that come with being a Mechanical Engineering major. 

So after my adderal (prescribed) started wearing off around midnight, I decided to buy a pack of Marlboro NXT's, popped in a fresh Menthol pod (I know I have a serious Nicotine problem), and chugged some redbull. While trying to maximize and elongate the effects of all of my addictions to stimulants (amphetamines, nicotine, caffeine)  I remembered something that I learned in my middle school health class, but I cannot seem to be able to adequately verify it online. Maybe I just don't have the time to do adequate research right now due to current time limitations and priorities, or maybe, like most things we learned in our middle school health class, this was also bullshit. Regardless, I am turning to you, the most intelligent people on the planet (reddit users), to try and get some answers (seriously, I made this account just for the answer to this question).

PROBLEM STATEMENT -- I remember learning about how nicotine can act as both a depressant and a stimulant, something about taking long drags of a cigarette vs. taking slow drags (an obvious correlation to dosage). I am a very heavy nicotine addict, as you probably gathered from reading this far, so this is definitely an important consideration if I wish to achieve my desired result (i.e. dopamine release, treating withdrawal, dependence, etc. all certainly have an impact in the way my body and mind respond to nicotine). For some reason when I chain smoke it does not necessarily stimulate me, but I feel slightly sedated (this contradicts what I found on google). In conclusion, I am trying to maximize the stimulation of my brain by abusing the chemical effects of nicotine. How do I achieve this? Should I intake it through slow large drags or quick small drags? Perhaps slow small drags or quick large drags (i.e. should I aim to intake a large dosage of nicotine quickly, a small dosage of nicotine slowly or vice-versa)? Has anyone done apt research into this phenomenon? any suggestions/tips/recommendations? 

P.S. I am open to any other suggestions in regards to stimulating my brain without substance abuse, so if you know of any I am more than willing to try them.",explainlikeimfive,1576567869

So this basic idea is that these are machines that will suck carbon out of the atmosphere and in some way or other store it, either in liquid form or in something like coal, actually, to bury back in the earth.

This one guy running this company that Bill Gates is backing, Carbon Engineering, has found a way to do this at a cost of $100 a ton of carbon. That means that you could totally neutralize all of the carbon emissions produced by the entire global economy. We would not have to change anything about the way we‚Äôre doing it, and we would be putting no additional carbon into the atmosphere for a total cost of about $3 trillion a year. That‚Äôs a lot of money, but there are estimates that we‚Äôre subsidizing the fossil fuel business globally $5 trillion a year.

So if we just redirected those subsidies towards those technologies, not only could we theoretically solve the problem, there are some complications, but theoretically, we could solve the problem immediately.

Chernobyl 2.0 fears as nuclear expert warns against re-opening cracked UK reactor.

Hunterston B nuclear power plant was shut down last year after it was found that one of the reactors had almost 400 cracks in it - exceeding the operational limit. 
  
Nuclear experts have warned against re-opening a 43-year-old Scottish nuclear reactor riddled with cracks over fears of a meltdown.  
  
Hunterston B nuclear power plant was shut down last year after it was found that Reactor 3 had almost 400 cracks in it - exceeding the operational limit.  
  
EDF, which own the plant in Ardrossan, Ayrshire, are pushing to return the reactor to service at the end of June and July and want to extend the operational limit of crack allowed from 350 to 700.  
  
However, the plans to reopen the plant have sparked fears it could lead to a nuclear meltdown similar to the 1986 Chernoybl disaster.  
  
Experts have warned that in the very worst case the hot graphite core could become exposed to air and ignite leading to radioactive contamination and evacuation of a large area of Scotland's central belt ‚Äì including Glasgow and Edinburgh.  
  
According to Dr Ian Fairlie, an independent consultant on radioactivity in the environment, and Dr David Toke, Reader in Energy Policy at the University of Aberdeen, the two reactors definitely should not be restarted.  
  
Speaking about the cracks in the barrels, they warned: ""This is a serious matter because if an untoward incident were to occur ‚Äì for example an earth tremor, gas excursion, steam surge, sudden outage, or sudden depressurisation, the barrels could become dislodged and/or misaligned.  
  
""These events could in turn lead to large emissions of radioactive gases.  
   
‚ÄúFurther, if hot spots were to occur and if nuclear fuel were to react with the graphite moderator they could lead to explosions inside the reactor core.  
  
""In the very worst case the hot graphite core could become exposed to air and ignite leading to radioactive contamination of large areas of central Scotland, including the metropolitan areas of Glasgow and Edinburgh.""  
  
A planned inspection of the graphite bricks that make up the core of reactor three in March last year uncovered new ""keyway root cracks"".  
  
Around 370 hairline fractures were found, which the BBC reports equates to about one in every 10 bricks in the reactor core.  
  
EDF Energy said these have now grown to an average of 2mm wide.  
   
The operational limit was 350 cracks but the inspection found this had been exceeded.   
  
Cracks to the graphite blocks is known to occur but legislation is in place to ensure they do not threaten the structural integrity of the reactor.   
  
EDF is now hoping to prove it is safe to use and would stand up to the most stringent tests and wants the ONR to increase the upper operational limit to 700  cracks.  
  
The reactors have been closed since October 2018, but EDF Energy said yesterday it was confident its Hunterston B nuclear plant would eventually reopen.  
  
Station Director Colin Weir said: ""Nuclear safety is our overriding priority and reactor three has been off for the year so that we can do further inspections.  
  
""We've carried out one of our biggest ever inspection campaigns on reactor three, we've renewed our modelling, we've done experiments and tests and we've analysed all the data from this to produce our safety case that we will submit to the ONR.  
  
""We have to demonstrate that the reactor will always shut down and that it will shut down in an extreme seismic event.""  
  
Tests and modelling have been undertaken to ensure that an earthquake would not distort the control channels and prevent the power station being shut down, the BBC reports.  
  
EDF Energy said a ¬£100 million million pound, 5-year research process had been undertaken into issues surrounding the lifetime of its plants.  
  
An EDF spokesperson added: ‚ÄúMarket rules mean we would immediately have to announce if this extensive research had altered our expectations about the closure of our power stations.""  
  
The city of Pripyat can only be visited by guided tour since the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 (Image: Neil Murphy / Daily Mirror)
She was responding to a report by the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a non-profit organisation, published on Friday, which said Britain‚Äôs climate target could be in jeopardy if the plant does not re-open and if the six other nuclear plants in Britain, with the same Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) design, were also forced to close early.  
  
‚ÄúIf this happens it is unlikely that the lights will go out, but it could make hitting our carbon targets more challenging,‚Äù said Jonathan Marshall author of the ECIU report.  
  
The ECIU report said the government should launch fresh support for new renewable projects, to ensure any gap in nuclear generation is filled by low-carbon sources instead of gas plants.  
  
EDF Energy said the scenario outlined in the report was unrealistic.  
  
The plant, which is more than 40 years old, can generate enough electricity to power more than 1.7 million homes, and is one of Britain‚Äôs eight nuclear plants which provide around 20 percent of the country‚Äôs electricity.  
  
What caused the explosion at Chernobyl?  
  
Chernobyl was considered a state-of-the-art nuclear power plant ‚Äì a triumph of USSR engineering.  
  
Chernobyl nuclear power plant
The exploded fourth reactor of Chernobyl nuclear power plant is seen in this aerial view April 1986
The station was built nine miles north-west of Chernobyl with the city of Pripyat constructed at around the same time, exclusively as a place for those who worked at the power plant to live.  
  
In September 1981 Reactor 1 suffered a partial meltdown - but the damage was minor and the accident was not made public until several years later.  
  
In the spring of 1986 Reactor 4 had recently come online and had begun producing power, however a series of tests still needed to be performed.  
  
The night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment and operators were unaware of the reactor flaws due to, among other things, the myriad of bureaucracy in the communist state.  
  
And Anatoly Dyatlov, the deputy chief engineer, chose to override safety protocols, such as starting the test when the reactor was generating a low amount of power - something that made it temperamental and hard to control.  
  
Despite the protests of some operators the test went ahead with almost none of the control rods inserted.  
  
Soon after the power levels began to spike.  
  
Alexander Akimov called for fail-safe button (AZ-5) to be pushed, inserting all the control rods to shut down the reactor.  
  
But the boron rods, designed to stop the reaction, had graphite tips.  
  
These displaced water in the lower parts of the core, leading to more steam and more reactivity.  
  
After just two seconds the chain reaction began to increase at an unstoppable speed.  
  
The reactor was destroying itself, parts reaching more than 3,000C.  
  
There was a series of steam explosions. These events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air, causing it to ignite and explode.

Experts have warned that in the very worst case the hot graphite core could become exposed to air and ignite leading to radioactive contamination and evacuation of a large area of Scotland's central belt ‚Äì including Glasgow and Edinburgh.  
  
According to Dr Ian Fairlie, an independent consultant on radioactivity in the environment, and Dr David Toke, Reader in Energy Policy at the University of Aberdeen, the two reactors definitely should not be restarted.  
  
Speaking about the cracks in the barrels, they warned: ""This is a serious matter because if an untoward incident were to occur ‚Äì for example an earth tremor, gas excursion, steam surge, sudden outage, or sudden depressurisation, the barrels could become dislodged and/or misaligned.  
  
""These events could in turn lead to large emissions of radioactive gases.  
   
‚ÄúFurther, if hot spots were to occur and if nuclear fuel were to react with the graphite moderator they could lead to explosions inside the reactor core.  
  
""In the very worst case the hot graphite core could become exposed to air and ignite leading to radioactive contamination of large areas of central Scotland, including the metropolitan areas of Glasgow and Edinburgh.""  
  
A planned inspection of the graphite bricks that make up the core of reactor three in March last year uncovered new ""keyway root cracks"".  
  
Around 370 hairline fractures were found, which the BBC reports equates to about one in every 10 bricks in the reactor core.  
  
EDF Energy said these have now grown to an average of 2mm wide.  
   
The operational limit was 350 cracks but the inspection found this had been exceeded.   
  
Cracks to the graphite blocks is known to occur but legislation is in place to ensure they do not threaten the structural integrity of the reactor.   
  
EDF is now hoping to prove it is safe to use and would stand up to the most stringent tests and wants the ONR to increase the upper operational limit to 700  cracks.  
  
The reactors have been closed since October 2018, but EDF Energy said yesterday it was confident its Hunterston B nuclear plant would eventually reopen.  
  
Station Director Colin Weir said: ""Nuclear safety is our overriding priority and reactor three has been off for the year so that we can do further inspections.  
  
""We've carried out one of our biggest ever inspection campaigns on reactor three, we've renewed our modelling, we've done experiments and tests and we've analysed all the data from this to produce our safety case that we will submit to the ONR.  
  
""We have to demonstrate that the reactor will always shut down and that it will shut down in an extreme seismic event.""  
  
Tests and modelling have been undertaken to ensure that an earthquake would not distort the control channels and prevent the power station being shut down, the BBC reports.  
  
EDF Energy said a ¬£100 million million pound, 5-year research process had been undertaken into issues surrounding the lifetime of its plants.  
  
An EDF spokesperson added: ‚ÄúMarket rules mean we would immediately have to announce if this extensive research had altered our expectations about the closure of our power stations.""

She was responding to a report by the Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU), a non-profit organisation, published on Friday, which said Britain‚Äôs climate target could be in jeopardy if the plant does not re-open and if the six other nuclear plants in Britain, with the same Advanced Gas-cooled Reactor (AGR) design, were also forced to close early.  
  
‚ÄúIf this happens it is unlikely that the lights will go out, but it could make hitting our carbon targets more challenging,‚Äù said Jonathan Marshall author of the ECIU report.  
  
The ECIU report said the government should launch fresh support for new renewable projects, to ensure any gap in nuclear generation is filled by low-carbon sources instead of gas plants.  
  
EDF Energy said the scenario outlined in the report was unrealistic.  
  
The plant, which is more than 40 years old, can generate enough electricity to power more than 1.7 million homes, and is one of Britain‚Äôs eight nuclear plants which provide around 20 percent of the country‚Äôs electricity.  
  
What caused the explosion at Chernobyl?  
  
Chernobyl was considered a state-of-the-art nuclear power plant ‚Äì a triumph of USSR engineering.  
  
Chernobyl nuclear power plant
The exploded fourth reactor of Chernobyl nuclear power plant is seen in this aerial view April 1986
The station was built nine miles north-west of Chernobyl with the city of Pripyat constructed at around the same time, exclusively as a place for those who worked at the power plant to live.  
  
In September 1981 Reactor 1 suffered a partial meltdown - but the damage was minor and the accident was not made public until several years later.  
  
In the spring of 1986 Reactor 4 had recently come online and had begun producing power, however a series of tests still needed to be performed.  
  
The night shift had very limited time to prepare for and carry out the experiment and operators were unaware of the reactor flaws due to, among other things, the myriad of bureaucracy in the communist state.  
  
And Anatoly Dyatlov, the deputy chief engineer, chose to override safety protocols, such as starting the test when the reactor was generating a low amount of power - something that made it temperamental and hard to control.  
  
Despite the protests of some operators the test went ahead with almost none of the control rods inserted.  
  
Soon after the power levels began to spike.  
  
Alexander Akimov called for fail-safe button (AZ-5) to be pushed, inserting all the control rods to shut down the reactor.  
  
But the boron rods, designed to stop the reaction, had graphite tips.  
  
These displaced water in the lower parts of the core, leading to more steam and more reactivity.  
  
After just two seconds the chain reaction began to increase at an unstoppable speed.  
  
The reactor was destroying itself, parts reaching more than 3,000C.  
  
There was a series of steam explosions. These events exposed the graphite moderator of the reactor to air, causing it to ignite and explode.

"ELI5: Bond investing , ROI and yields"," I am new to finance and am trying to understand the basics of bond metrics

Say there is a bond with par value of $1000, 4% annual coupon and 10 years to maturity. Say the discount/market rate today is 1.5%, which would mean the price of the bond is $1230.55¬†

If I buy this bond today and hold it to maturity, regardless of what happens to future interest rates, I spend $1230.55 today and get a total cashflow stream of $40 per year \* 10 years + my principal back at the end, so a total of 400+1000= $1400

At this point, my brain would say, OK, I spent $1230.55 and got $1400, so $1400-1230.55= 169.45 of.....profit? If I divide this profit by my investment, I get 169.45/1230.55= \~14%. Or in other words, my ROI on this investment is 14%.....right?

Everything I read about bonds is that they are measured in yields, yield to maturity, etc. The current yield above would be 3.25% and 1.5% yield to maturity

I guess my question is.... the 3.25% and 1.5% figures make this investment seem fairly mediocre. However, where I work in the engineering field, a 14% proposed ROI on a new project or buying new/faster equipment would be considered pretty damn good. But projects take work and machines fail, so why would we move forward with anything if we could just buy those bonds and sit on our asses and collect 14%? Or in another way, the average S&amp;P return over time is something like 11%..is a bond like this basically a free ticket to market beating returns? I guess Im confused as to why everyone fusses over the yields and interest rate changes which are tied to the secondary market, when buying a single digit coupon rate bond will almost always give you double digit ROI in the long run.

While banking and finance seemingly has remained fundamentally the same since probably the 1970s, technology has made basically every task they do easier. Personal banking like payments, transfers, savings, stock trading has become basically automated through online banking. Even getting a mortgage or car loan, at least in Norway, is an application in the online bank, and most of the necessary data is collected automatically. Stock trading is more than ever handled by computer programs and advanced algorithms, nobody's shouting SELL at the floor of the stock exchange anymore. I'm sure the other tasks that banks perform have also become easier, and all tasks are now able to be performed by fewer people.

which says:

&gt; some research and development costs can be capitalized (i.e. turned into an asset on the company‚Äôs¬†[balance sheet](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/balance-sheet/)) instead of being incurred as an expense on the statement of Profit and Loss ([P&amp;L](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/accounting/profit-and-loss-statement-pl/)). 

&amp;#x200B;

So If I am a company making widgets and my engineering department spend $50 in making the widgets ( paying staff, buildings, prototypes etc.) does that mean that if I choose to not capitalise this cost then it becomes a loss, but if I do capitalise the spending then it's technically an asset I could choose to sell (the IP/rights/documentation/prototypes). 

&amp;#x200B;

how do you actually capitalise something do you just write it down in a different part of your accounting documents?

ELI5: Why does the OS matter when choosing camera modules for tablets?,"&amp;#x200B;

Recently I was contacting a supplier for designing an OEM Tablet for a Work Environment. We wanted a tablet with an adequate built in camera with a certain amount of Megapixels.

For us it was 10MP at minimum and we wanted a tablet that could run windows OS so we can run our company‚Äôs existing scripts on it without drastic redesigns.

Now the my point of contact told me that if I wanted the best possible camera for the Tablet, they could do:

\-Windows OS: 8.0MP

\-Android OS: 13.0MP

This struck me as weird because in my mind I couldn‚Äôt compute why an OS would matter. I tried asking her but she was a salesperson and she couldn‚Äôt answer. I am guessing sales and engineering/design don‚Äôt really tell each other much. So if anyone can provide any insight into this weird world of Tablet Cameras that would be swell. 

Additional Information:

\-This was an OEM (original equipment manufacturer) company, no specific branding 

\-For reference: MS Surface Pro for examples uses also 8.0MP and the Lenovo Tab also uses the 8.0MP and uses Windows OS too. So I don‚Äôt think the engineers are just arbitrarily saying no.

The penis is a bit like a balloon, add internal pressure and up he rises. The pressure is supplied by the blood flow into and out of the penis. If you block the exit flow with a controlling 'valve' (a sphincter muscle closing off the exit vein) then the back pressure will fill the penis. Sproing! There needs to be a method to control this valve of course which I presume is a combination of hormones and nerves.

So what can go wrong? 
I'm guessing the possible faults are a blocked artery to the penis, a failed sphincter muscle on the blood flow out or a failure in the control system such as low testosterone? All of the above?

***

So I'm studying electrical engineering but something I've never really grasped is grounding, particularly in higher voltage/transmission contexts. 

For example, a power line, or an overhead line for an electric railway, if I was to get shocked, the current is going from the line, through me, to... where exactly? 

From everything I understand current has to be a complete circuit to flow, but if I was only touching live and not return/neutral then the current must go somewhere else, right?

Does the current literally travel through hundreds of miles through the ground to get back to the power station? 

Does all electricity just naturally want to get to the ground? 

Is it something we do intentionally at regular places so that electricity always has a path to 'ground'? And if so, why? Doesn't that make it infinitely more dangerous

How come standing on things that are not very conductive doesn't change the fact I could get shocked if I touched something of high voltage?

Or am I misunderstanding everything because to have a voltage in the first place it must be with reference to *something* and that something is always the ground?

ELI5: Why is linear regression used to find a best-fit line equation when an equation that's much more accurate for forecasting can be identified using cos() and sin() coefficients?,"This may primarily make more sense with cyclical data sets, such as measurement of temperature over years, ups and downs in the stock market, or seasonal retail sales.

Given some data we can perform linear regression to establish a function that explains some of the variance in the data, but it seems to me like using combinations of sin() or cos() coefficients may yield a much more accurate function with a very high or near perfect r-square value.

For example, imagine a retail business looking to forecast sales month-by-month for next year. They have data from the last five years, where they started with $1,000,000 in sales. Sales usually always picks up around the holidays, and then dies down throughout the rest of year. The business is also growing by $100k each year. A simple linear regression might show just the growth, or average increasing yearly sales, something like:

f(x) = 0.1x + 1

Where x is years and f(x) would be sales (in millions). Now, to better represent the fluctuations throughout each year and calculate future sales at any point (say, next October) an equation like this might be better representative:

f(x) = 0.1x + 1 + 0.2cos(œÄx)

This would still show sales growing by $100k annually but will also represent the seasonal variance throughout each year, with the best day of the year 0.2 above average and the worst 0.2 below average (in millions).

Playing around with adding several different cos and sin coefficients to a single function yields some fairly interesting patterns and it seems to me that you could probably even design a function complicated enough to fit all your data points and get a near-perfect r-square value.

From my understanding, this whole concept is somewhat similar to a Fourier transform. If so, why is that subject typically reserved for electrical engineering and not considering a purely statistical or mathematical subject?",explainlikeimfive,1537701392

It said the 3.0-liter V6 produced 142hp at 5000rpm and for the torque, 173 lb ft at 2400rpm.

Using the math I learned on finding hp, I tried:

173 x 2400/5252 = 79.06

which meant I got 79hp from the 2400rpm.

If Plymouth wanted a Voyager which was a fuel-sipping model, would it have to have lower hp, lower torque, and for a sporty version, more hp, lower torque, or is it lower hp, more torque? [if you were to say, expand the 3.0-liter V6 to 200hp].

What's the actual relationship between torque/lb ft and hp, especially when it comes to automobile publications like the one in the link above, and the hp listed [the 142hp at 5000rpm], is that the *maximum* one?

I've been learning the basics on calculations of torque and hp from [this source](http://www.metaris.com/hp-relations.php).

Although I've learnt the basic math, I'm trying to ensure my understanding is correct.

Obviously, car magazines have to be accurate, but for a beginner like me, how can I understand how they got the figures such as the 3.0-liter V6 with 142hp at 5000rpm and torque of 173lb ft at 2400rpm.

According to the [spec](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-Structure.html), we start with the PNG signature which is the first 8 bytes.  
&gt; 89504E47 0D0A1A0A  
We then have repeating ""chunk"" structures, this file has 3 ""chunks"", the header (IHDR), the image data (IDAT) and then the end ""chunk"" (IEND).  
Each chunk is arranged into: the first 4 bytes for the length of the chunk data, 4 bytes for the type of data, n-bytes for the actual data and then 4 bytes for the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) of the type of data and actual data sections. 
Following this through...  
&gt; 0000000D  
Is the chunk's data length (13 bytes).  
&gt; 49484452  
Is the chunk type (IHDR).  
&gt; 00000004 00000004 08020000 00  
Is the chunk data (4 bytes width, height; 1 byte bit depth, colour type, compression method, filter method, interlace method).  
&gt; 269309 29  
Is the CRC of the data and type (managed to get the code to work this out from [here](http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/spec/1.2/PNG-CRCAppendix.html).  
&gt; 000000 3F  
Is the chunk's data length (63 bytes).

That answer:

Alcohol does freeze at a lower temperature than water, so the part that freezes would be water \(I‚Äôd expect; but I‚Äôm just another engineer, not some science guy\). It‚Äôs just unlikely that you could chill a beer to exactly the right temperature to freeze every bit of the water but none of the alcohol, so that alcohol could then run out without any water in it. It would be easy to test for that; if you tasted the liquid and it was nearly 200 proof alcohol you‚Äôd certainly know it.

Given that anti\-freeze in your car works based on having alcohol as one main ingredient it stands to reason that the mix of the two liquids freezes at a lower temperature than having water freeze at 0 and alcohol remain liquid below that. Pressure comes into play as another related factor, but we‚Äôre past what I can remember from chemistry basics classes ages ago shedding light on how that works, and I‚Äôm too lazy to use Google to try and sort it out.

In 1984, Nissan sold the Maxima as the Nissan-Datsun Maxima in the U.S. and Canada and this was understandable, since the brand was rebranding from Datsun to Nissan.

However, I never understood why [at the time] that General Motors were planning to market the Chevrolet Corvette in the United Kingdom in 1998 as the Vauxhall Chevrolet Corvette [until it was decided to only sell it as a Chevrolet in 1998], despite huge brand recognition for Chevrolet and the vehicle. This was from a magazine article I read in 1997.

Other vehicles I've seen with double-badging were the Chevrolet Oldsmobile Cutlass in Mexico and Chevrolet Buick Century [although I believe that was due to Government law at the time], although neither actually wore the Chevrolet bowtie badge - they still had the Buick tri-shield and Oldsmobile text on them.

In Mexico, they had the Ford Sable - essentially identical to the Mercury Sable sold in the U.S. and Canada from 1996 to 1999, except with the Mercury badge on it.

However, there was oddities/exceptions like the [Toyota Voltz](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7b/Toyota_Voltz_%28Japan%29._The_JDM_market_version_of_the_Pontiac_Vibe.jpg/1280px-Toyota_Voltz_%28Japan%29._The_JDM_market_version_of_the_Pontiac_Vibe.jpg) - identical to the Pontiac Vibe sold in the U.S. and Canada, but with Pontiac badging and wheelcovers - no Toyota badging at all.

Why do automobile manufacturers do this, even when a brand has strong recognition and is popular?

I understand, for example, Fenway Park because of Landsdowne St, but why not standardize dimensions from home to each section after it became more prominent of a sport?

Why not limit the sizes of the outfield walls so that a home run to one stadium would be a home run in another stadium? A ball belted out of left field in Arizona would be remedied because of an architectural design at Fenway park. How is that not an unfair advantage for Boston?

"ELI5: Accounting for energy losses and additional production and material costs, how is it STILL more efficient than gas for electric cars?","I know this has been asked before in various ways but think about all the ways energy is lost and as a result the electric car becomes less efficient :

1. Coal burned at power plant 
2. This generated electricity is run over hundreds of miles of lines (loss of efficiency) 
3. Some high tension lines go from AC to DC and through several substations (transmission loss) 
4. The endpoint, your house, is converted back to ac. (loss) 
5.  The charging unit for electric cars from what I understand is DC, so another conversion (loss) 
6. Energy is now stored in batteries with self dissipation and loss going from car charger to batteries as heat. 
7. Efficiency of motor is not 100% so there is loss of efficiency there as well. 

Also factor in the additional energy required to produce hundreds of pounds of lithium batteries and dispose of them at end of its useful life (or recycle - still requiring energy) probably long before the car is dead. 

So with ALL these things, is it REALLY still more efficient than gas?  Like if we factor it all in does it take 10 pounds of coal to go 100 miles?  Or how can we take the whole system into account and compare apples to apples? 

Disclaimer : I have no idea if any of the above steps are even real, just things I was thinking about and having a hard time trying to grasp the whole picture. 

Thanks!

ps. I flaired this as engineering, hope that is appropriate. Couldn't think of the best fit.

Long story short I am a foreign student who ended up in a master class about aerospace engineering. My speciality is electronics.

I have those Lagrangian differential equations describing the trajectory of a satellite or a missile: http://imgur.com/Q0VbzUv

where:

- T : kinetic energy
- theta: angle of the polar coordinates used to describe the trajectory

Qr and Qtheta are generalized forces where the former equals the negative  partial derivative of the potential energy with respect to r (distance of the polar coordina) and the latter with respect to theta (of the polar coordinate)

What is unclear to me:

I see a dot denoting a derivative (conventions used in mechanics), I see a partial derivative and a derivative with respect to time. Is that a tripple derivative?


I can't get a grasp of the formula. in other words would someone be able to do an eli5 explaining the logics behind this formula: why we substract derivatives from each other and how it comes this equals to those ""generalized forces""?

"ELI5: in Car Key Fobs (and similar), how do we guard against discovery of the algorithm for generating the sequence of codes?","When I use my key fob to unlock my car, it sends a signal to my car, and my car recognises that signal and unlocks the door.

To my understanding, it doesn't send the same signal twice. If it sent the same signal repeatedly, it would be easy to intercept and reproduce that signal. So instead, it sends the next number in a mathematically generated sequence. The car recognises that the number it receives is the next one in the sequence (over-simplification - it actually accepts any of the next several requests in case I press the button and the car doesn't receive the signal, but that's not relevant to the question), and responds to it.

So my question: what's to stop someone from discovering this sequence? Perhaps they could do it by reverse engineering a key, or perhaps someone who works for a car company could leak it. And if I discovered this sequence, could I build a device which intercepted a signal and reproduced the next number in the sequence, and use that to break into someone's car?

In computer cryptography, algorithms are public, but use things like public/private key pairs to ensure privacy. I suspect something similar is used here, but unless the car and the key fob both contain some kind of private key, I can't figure out how it works. Thanks!",explainlikeimfive,1481188547

ELI5: How do people with massive student loans pay them off and how do they get them in the first place?," It has been stated that the average American college student graduates with around 25k in student debt after a 4-year degree. That is considered alarming by many and some say that there is a student debt crisis in the U.S. 

But I can see people paying off 25k. It's about the cost of a car. It may be burdensome or unfair, but anybody can be reasonably expected to pay that off.

 Then there are people who have 100k-200k in student debt. How do they pay that off? With amounts that massive, at least half of the amount must have come from private lenders. I can understand a doctor or an engineer paying that off as these career paths lead to high salaries. But what about those who take out such loans for less lucrative degrees? 

 Moreover, how does it work from a lender's perspective? I can understand doctors since they can expect a high salary and medical school have a very high graduation and job placement rate. But why would a lender risk 6 figures on a law or engineering student who is much more likely to drop out and, in the case of a law student, much less likely to find a high-paying job? That goes double for courses of study where high compensation isn't even on the table. How do they figure they will get their money back?

ELI5:Why does a ringed structure tend to break in two places?,"I am a radiology resident and one of the fundamental tenets that we are taught regarding musculoskeletal radiology is that ringed structures in the body tend to break in two places (pelvis, mandible, tibia/fibula).  Although anecdotally it seems to be a common phenomenon, I have seen many exceptions to this rule in clinical practice, and feel uncomfortable accepting this as a ""rule of nature"".     In my reading the only explanation I can find is ""think of a pretzel! You can't break it in one place!"" - which is not satisfying at all to me.

ELI5: Excel Correlation Analysis: me vs. my boss,"I work at a company that produces paper and the paper has to be measured by a density machine for quality purposes. Recently, the company has purchased a newer model of the density machine to replace the outdated one. My boss has given me the job to test the paper on both machines and compare the results in excel. The procedure is to obtain the sample and put in in the machine, which measures the density, and then put the SAME SAMPLE in the new machine. My problem is, with my knowledge of math, I should compare the two data sets on the y-axis and the sample number on the x-axis, in order to compare them against each other at the same sample number. He thinks the data set 1 should be on x-axis and data set 2 should be on y-axis. I feel like that can't be the case, considering that comparing x to x isn't a function, and graphs are just representations of functions (an input and an output). He thinks graphing two inputs should give a better correlation? 
Ex:
His idea x/y = (98.2mm,96.2mm) 
My idea x/y1,y2 = (sample 1, 98.2mm, 96.2mm)

[Update] Category flair is here! (and more),"Hey!


We've been working on a large ELI5 update for the past few weeks. So let's break it down into the different things that have been added/changed:


---

###Category flairs


Gone is the barely-used Explained flair. We now have category flairs so you can easily see the kind of question being asked - *and* you can also filter by category using the buttons on the sidebar. From now on, assigning a flair to your question is mandatory.


**Note:** the categories may change in the near future as we see fit so we can better accomodate all the kinds of questions users ask here.


Current categories:

- Mathematics

- Economics 

- Biology

- Culture

- Chemistry

- Physics

- Engineering

- Other


###'Repost' flair


This is a special flair for when a commonly asked question is spotted.


The responses to [the recent reposts survey](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/4i6nt9/modpost_looking_for_your_thoughts_on_common/) gave us a lot of insight about what you guys think about reposts: about 60% think that reposts lower the quality of the subreddit, while 40% think they either improve the subreddit or they just don't affect it. 


If we outright remove all reposts, 40% of the userbase will be missing out on questions they would've liked to see. If we let them be, 60% of the userbase will be annoyed because of the frequent common reposts.


So what's our solution? We let each of you choose. Reposts will be allowed, but if you don't like seeing them, you can filter them out *permanently* via RES ([here's how to do it](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/wiki/reposts)).


This way, whoever likes reposts can see them, and whoever doesn't can filter them out, and everyone is happy (we hope). Unfortunately, the only way we know of to filter a flair permanently is via RES, but if you know other ways, let us know.

###Automatically generated FAQ


One of the most popular remarks in the recent reposts survey was that we need a more up-to-date FAQ. 


The problem about making a FAQ is that there are, unsurprisingly, loads of commonly asked questions. That means manually putting together a FAQ takes a lot of time and effort, as well as a lot of maintenance every month or two. This is why in the past, whenever we tried to make a new FAQ, it ended up becoming outdated and incomplete after a few months.


Our solution to this: an automatically generated FAQ.


So how does it work? Well, a few weeks ago I've made a bot (written in Python) that, among other things, runs a search for every new question using the keywords in its title (reddit's search is keyword based). If it finds more than a few threads (and they are reasonably recent), the question is reported as a potential repost (so we can flair it) and an entry to the FAQ is added containing the question and its search results.



The automatic generation ensures that the FAQ is up-to-date at all times and without manual intervention. We will, however, keep an eye on it and clean it from time to time.


The downside to this is that, right now, the FAQ is quite empty. However, as time progresses and users ask the same ol' questions, it will get populated very quickly (it gets about 10-20 new entries a day).


To access the FAQ, you can click the button on the sidebar or click [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/wiki/faq). Please note that it is WIP.


###CSS update


The CSS was getting a little dated, so we've updated it with a new look, new link flair functionality, completely reworked sidebar and RES nightmode compatibility. We hope you like it, and if you spot any errors please message us. Credits for the CSS update: /u/cow_co and myself.


---

Anyhow, that's all for now. As always, you can provide feedback and ideas in /r/ideasforELI5. We hope you enjoy the update!

ELI5:Why do jet engines become more efficient at a higher temperature?,"I'm an undergrad economics major taking a GE class in materials engineering (its basic intro class for non-engineers) but our project this quarter is to interview a PHD student in the materials department and write an essay about their research. Basically the student I interviewed is constructing ceramic matrix composites using SiC fibers embedded in bulk SiC ceramic. Long story short, the application for this is for jet engine turbine blades because a brittle ceramic material that can be made stronger with fibers, can withstand temperatures higher than the current nickel based superalloy they are now using for turbine blades. 

So, apparently if this can be done and we can begin using these CMC's for turbine blades, the engines will be able to burn hotter (1500C instead of the current 1000-1200C) and this will be extremely fuel efficient for commercial and military planes. So my question is WHY will a turbine that can withstand hotter temperatures burn LESS fuel and save on potentially billions in fuel costs for the airline industry? 

I know this is a specific question, but I figured at least one of you 7.466 million subscribers might know something about jet engines or turbine blades. Also, not sure if my explanation is 100% accurate, I'm just trying to put my interview with this guy into words (this isn't my specialty, I work with Supply and Demand graphs, ugh).

ELI5: Why does it take so long to design a modern military aircraft?,"I was looking at the developments of the aircraft in war, and I realized that in World War II, it took about a year to design a fighter, in 50s/60s it was several years, in 70s/80s over a decade, and 21st century stuff like F-22 and F-35(both programs started in 20th) about a quarter of a century. What's obvious is, of course it will be harder to design a more complex and advanced project, however one should realize that today we have advanced computer simulations and engineering software that weren't available to WW2/Early Cold War engineers. Hell they didn't even have a calculator. All pencil, paper, and a wind tunnel at most. At this rate, it seems like, 50 years from now, it will take a century or so to design a military aircraft, just like the old Medieval Cathedrals that took centuries to complete.

ELI5: Virtual displacements/work and why they are used.,"I'm a graduate mechanical engineering student so virtual displacement and work have popped up many times. After getting explanations in 4+ undergraduate/graduate courses, reading explanations in textbooks, and googling, I still struggle greatly with this concept. Maybe at this point not so much on it's definition, but it's usefulness and application.

**What I know**

A virtual displacement of some particle, body, etc, takes place instantaneous. It is effectively zero (infinitesimally small) and follows the ""rules"" (constraints) for motion of whatever system you are looking at.

Virtual work is the work associated with a virtual displacement. Since the virtual displacement is infinitesimally small and happens instantaneously, the virtual work is zero. 

These quantities can be used in physics/engineering problems to find things like generalized forces or to find the actual path of a particle (among many other things).

**What confuses me**

Why do these exist (in the theoretical world)? Why do we need to think in terms of virtual displacements/work to get information we want? How are these correlated to what we actually see in whatever system we are looking at?

----------------------------------

I've seen virtual work and displacement used in my school work to say certain things about whatever is being analyzed. I have personally gone through problems and gotten real results using these concepts. However, it all seems utterly meaningless to me. It's not like Newtons Second Law (F=ma) where I have a good physical understanding of what the math actually means. When I use virtual quantities I lose all physical sense of what I am actually doing in the problem which makes these types of problems very difficult for me. ",explainlikeimfive,1450538681

Even more if you're a submariner, but I'd stick with surface fleet.

- Lots of training opportunities, it seems they often sponsor you to train
- 6 weeks paid holiday a year (!)
- Military pension (which you don't need to pay into)
- Free healthcare, dental care, etc
- Free accommodation, food, etc.
- The position I'm interesting in was a non-degree engineering role. Getting trained up to fix engines, electronics, piping, etc, so you'd be getting valuable experience which you could use in civilian life
- Travel the world, I could be in a new country every few months, etc.
- Possibility to help people on humanitarian missions.
- All the other interesting stuff that the military involves. Sailing around on a high-tech ship, operating guns and missiles and radar systems, etc.

It was kind of like an introduction meant to give us ideas about what we can do in his field further on so it was brief but I remember two things that really stuck out to me.

1. The professor mentioned that there is apparently no proof that the Navier Stokes equation exists in 3D in that there is even a $1M prize to show one. How can this be when we are clearly using it already to design planes and rockets and engines and things? Obviously it works right, because the rockets we design with CFD actually shoot up into space and so on so doesn't this mean that it's real?

2. What exactly are the NS equations? Because to me doesn't it just seem to be the conservation of momentum and mass and energy equations, but used together? Why do Navier and Stokes get credit for what looks like they just combined Newtons laws of conservations?

3. The professor also mentioned about turbulence, basically it's a very hard thing to do and we don't know how it truly works yet. How is this possible that we don't know it and what makes it additionally difficult to ""do""?

This looks like something that there can't possibly be any actual science behind, but there's this study here that seems to prove, using the scientific method, that it actually worked. I can't seem to find a link to the full study, but there's got to be some catch.

The reason I'm so skeptical is because if said ""meditative process"" was proven to actually have an effect on the operation of an electronic device according to the ""intent"" that was focused on, there would undoubtedly be tons more research done on it to figure out how it works, what the limits are, etc. At the same time, there would certainly be tons of news about the shocking results of said study.

Normally if I see something like this on the Internet and I can't really find any actual evidence to back up the claim, I'd simply dismiss it and move on. But what's confusing me here is that on a website owned by the National Institute of Health, which I doubt would publish unverified information, and it says the study was conducted by professor at Stanford's Material Science and Engineering department.

2e1. How much fuel would be needed to get to near light speed and then slow down again? Where would this fuel be stored? Would fuel ""pit stops"" need to be set up first to achieve farther and farther locations?

It seems that the single column for launch is a great idea... why haven't the scientists tried to launch as a single traditional rocket shape, and then, instead of awkwardly trying to land a huge singe column, have the tanks expand into a locking bad mitten type shape for landing and re-use? It seems the aerodynamics would benefit the landing process (as most capsules have that shape ) , and the extra weight would be minimal with splitable tank combination, as the spacex reusable rocket is surely using extra weight for propellant to attempting the difficult task of slowing down and landing a huge single column on descent. Doesn't it make since to morph the shape from a single column shape after launch to a badminton shape for landing? Has anyone not even thought of this?

=============

Hey guys... still waiting... 

here is my reasoning:
Ok, I don't have the time to respond with a detailed drawing....
But I think everyone is not putting their minds to the possibility.
I dotn have time to give a sketch, but what if the largest tank was the center tank.
and the center tank was a reinforced simple cylinder design.
And there was an external ring configuration that would even possibly be either magnetically or per bearings operated as a sleeve collar around this massive and structurally rigid/robust and simplistic main central tank.
Picture a large flag/telephone pole. Expand on that. That is in the center of the rocket
On top of the engine. If the rocket could initiate controlled spin on liftoff, this centrifugal force could then be used to release the collar/magnetic sleeve on the center column tank.
Miniature cables/Kevlar strips/ Combo would allow the outside tanks lining the walls surrounding the central column tank to expand, with the help from the centrifical force on take off.
A minimal pair of locking extension bars could support the extended surrounding tanks.
The space between the extended now opened surrounding flanged tanks, which are opened by centrifugal force alone, yet tethered to the magnetic collar, could be filled by an ultra strong /light weight Kevlar like material.
The air braking alone would save weight on initial launch.
The reinforced main central tank would save weight lowering the number of chambers required to carry fuel.
The centrifugal force magnetic sleeve with connected tethers would contain few parts to fail or obstructions.
The computer iq and external thrusting operations, back up systems , propellant and subsystems/manpower engineering power, and failure due to external atmospheric events to control a managed multi story single cylandar would all be made redundant .
Every one says KISS.
a rigid, light weight cone structure, which launched as a cylindrical structure, will be much easier to land and control its descent. And cheaper even.
I will make the effort to draw a collar based cylindrical design with a central sliding magnetic collar with the surrounding tanks expanded to a cone shaped recoverable rocket structure if needed and you cant see what I am saying from my description here alone. Sorry I have 4 kids and a bit busy limited time to type. I am astounded someone thinks the process more complex any other way.
Nothing is more simple than a huge ultra-heavy duty hinge joint on each extended side of the rocket body which becomes a flange.
Reinforced kevlar or other light weight extendable material to provide blocking.air braking functional material between the extended flanges for landing is light weight.
Rotational cylindrical force required to extend the flanges, and provide a more conventional easily controlled descent per a conal shape ... well isnt that a no brainer?
Please tell me there is someone here that gets what I am saying without the need to provide diagrams...
And please I hope realize that the centrifugal force of a controlled spin on launch, such as done with a bullet launched from a gun, this would only be used to release the collar extending the flanges after the payload has been released and the cylindrical rocket is morphing into its cone shape for landing/reuse.
The reuse procedure would be to simply inspect the meshing between flanges, inspect collar and hinges, inspect extensible hinge locking bars and locking joints.
All of these parts would only bear the weight of the empty tanks and forces on landing from payload release, which would not require almost any computer control at all... as the main work is accomplished by centrifugal force leading to flange release.",explainlikeimfive,1437851679

I understand I need to transform the network topology into a matrix and solve it to for eg: the complex currents on the lines and the voltages at the busses.  However I'm not sure what the best mapping from topology to matrix looks like.

My thought currently is to model the 3-phase lines as an equivalent single phase line (since it's balanced) and use KVL/mesh analysis where each mesh is the line from one bus to its neighbor and back along an imaginary neutral.  That gets me the currents on each line and from that I can find voltages and power at the buses/loads.  I'm pretty sure this would work but it definitely feels like the naive approach.

What do you think about my engineering ideas,"The first idea is that you can create a program in which a person enters data about his body and the load that falls on this body, as well as the region in which the user lives.  After that, you can go to the next menu of the program and enter there the amount of money that a person is ready to spend and the number of days for which he wants to make a food menu for himself or for a group of people, and as a result, the program issues an interactive menu with a balanced diet that you can print and learn from it  where and at what prices it will be cheaper to buy products for preparing dishes from the menu, as well as how exactly to prepare dishes from the menu.  A person receives a balanced nutrition menu for the amount that he entered and for the number of days and people that were entered, plus detailed instructions on how to cook and where to buy food.  As I think such a program can help many.  I have a demo, but I didn't populate the database in it.  In my version of the program for compiling a menu for one day, random dishes are taken from the database and until their set meets the criteria for a balanced menu for the day, and if there is enough money, the program will select the menu again.  I thought that if all people start using this program (they still want their food to be healthy and suitable for the wallet), then it might turn out that in one city there will be an excess of some kind of product, and in another there will be a shortage.  The first thing that came to my mind was that in this case it is possible to transport products from cities with an excess to cities with a shortage, and if this works out, then in this way it is possible to provide the entire planet with food.  You can also edit the program so that it would immediately count on some region and its number of people and on the number of products that are in the region.
 The second idea is related to how uninhabited regions of the Earth can be explored.  It consists in the fact that there is such a company https://www.rtiexploration.com/ (I give an example on it because I did not find companies working in the same direction)
 It is engaged in the fact that with the help of various equipment it can scan the earth for the presence of any substances, whether it be minerals, minerals or water and oil, and soil analysis is also possible with their technologies.  As it is written on the site, they are able to find water at a depth of up to 3 km underground.  As I understood from studying the information on how these technologies work, they can be used to compile an interactive map of the planet Earth, which will show where and at what depth any minerals are located and also the ability of the soil in this place to be fertile.  This is one part of the project, the other is to make models of buildings and streets and fields for growing products, which can be endowed with characteristics showing what conditions in the form of land under and next to them are needed in order to be able to put them in this place.  Thus, having these data, you can create a program that will itself try to place fields, roads and buildings in such a way as to ensure the fastest possible and long-term settlement to which this program will also virtually bring all the necessary communications, including you can calculate where this new  the region will receive products and all useful resources for its existence.  All these calculations can be performed by a pre-programmed program.  Thus, it is possible to populate new territories and rebuild old ones.
 The third program, as I called it ""electronic checks"".  The bottom line is that now all over the world at the state level they are testing state cryptocurrencies with the help of which you can see who gave what time and how much money to whom.  Also now in many countries they practice such a thing as a fiscal check.  In it you can see on the Internet how much and for what money was paid at a certain time.  As a result, it turns out that the state partially has information on money transfers, in which it is clear who gave what money to whom and for what.  Assuming that in the future there will be a rejection of paper money and all money transfers will be covered by such data, it is possible to provide the same coverage only for our time using, for example, the same blockchain technology in order to record who exactly has what kind of paper money.  This can be determined by the banknote number that the owner of this money will write down in the newly created accounting system.  In the future, when using this method, for each monetary transaction, record from whom and to whom which banknote was transferred.  Thus, to start using this system, oblige everyone to write down those banknotes that they have in the system, and those banknotes that were not recorded can return, for example, back to the state that issued them.  As a result, when using this program, you can completely get rid of monetary corruption, since all money transfers will be recorded and can be viewed in a separate system.

 As I think the first two ideas can fully cover the basic needs of a person in food, water and a place to live, and the third can ensure the reliability of the transfer of money.

Career progression: getting a PhD vs going into industry at entry level,"What's the career progression like for working at large established companies when you're starting at entry level?  I've heard a few people say that they are going to get their PhD because you can either do that or work for company for \~10ish years to get to the same place (or sometimes there's just glass ceilings put in place).  I'm interested in wearables which is maybe sort of niche (I only really know that the big tech companies hire for it, and most require at least a Masters).  I have a job offer for an entry level position in wearable instrumentation (it looks like mainly just debugging hardware): when I think about what I want to do long term it's more than just debugging hardware (I'd be more interested in the design/conception more so than just troubleshooting what already exists).  I know usually you can either advance up management or try and stay on the technical side, but how does that actually work, and if you did take a entry level role somewhat adjacent to what you actually wanted to do, how did that end up for you and where are you now?  If I'm interested in staying more so on the technical side, more so on the design specifically (or making my own stuff), does a PhD make more sense than just entering entry level and working my way through?  I'm just not sure what the endpoints are for either career path (PhD vs nonPhD) if I know I want to work in industry, maybe my own company.

People who didn't get a PhD, what stuff are you working on now compared to what you originally intended and do you wish you had gotten a PhD, and for people who did get a PhD and go into industry, same question but flipped.

My friends will frequently bring up ""oh while you're getting your PhD I'll have earned XYZ amount while you're that far behind"" which is true, but I'm not looking to get a PhD for the money, but rather so I can work on the problems that I want (at my school almost all the engineers just go into consulting, which is fine, but not really what I'm looking to do).

My own background: I'm a senior mechanical engineer looking at going to graduate school for electrical engineering.  I have a few interviews I'm in the process for right now, but I've already been accepted to a few graduate schools (tuition paid, with a small but livable stipend).  I'm most interested in VR/AR/wearables/haptics, more so towards the hardware side than just the CS side, so I'm trying to figure out if an advanced degree is really worth it / required.  Big caveat being I don't know that much about any of those topics at this moment, as I haven't had any classes or projects specifically in those areas.  Coming from mechanical I frequently hear that at places like Lockheed/Raytheon, the PhDs design everything and everyone else does the fabrication / failure analysis / GD&amp;T / etc. which I don't know how true that is or if it generalizes to other fields.",AskEngineers,1646150239

Help - New University student's crysis,"Hello everyone,

I find myself writing this post because I'm slowly but consistently feeling worse, up to a point where I'll be in a constant paralyzing state of panic. Now I know this is not a subreddit about psychology or personal help, so I'll keep that at a minimum; let's focus on the career side.  

  

Just a bit of context - and please don't misunderstand it as bragging.

I'm 19 years old. I've started studying Comp Science &amp; Engineering this September in Italy's best Engineering school, which is also highly renowned both in Europe and worldwide. I've always been pretty good at ""school stuff"", although admittedly not outstanding, but because of my laziness rather than difficulty in understanding the matter. In fact, I rarely ever needed to study (scientific disciplines - maths, physics, chemistry) in High School, and my grades were only held back by my lack of exercise (I definitely had to study some history though.) However, those few times when I really needed to give everything I had, I did it - for example, to pass the hard admission test for this University, which I completed one year early and thus secured admission (you are automatically accepted if you score &gt;60% one year before actually finishing HS, and I did 75%).

This ""path"" and specific moment is something that I've always wanted and looked forward to. I've been tinkering with computers since I was a child; I started coding at 10 and ""published"" (as in, posted online and got decent appreciation)  my first project in 2014, when I was 12. But my interest was not only limited to programming; in fact, I also love both networking and physics - I currently have a few homelabs with a few hypervisors running some interesting stuff, and I'm still constantly tinkering with them exactly like I did when I was a child - expanding hardware, installing new software, trying different configurations and filesystems...

Anyways, this is to say that Computer Engineering sounded like the best ""path"" for me, as I was much better in scientific disciplines compared to literature and history, and given my absolute passion about the matter.

I started going to University one month before actual lessons because I wanted to ensure that I could do my best, and even attended Physics and Calculus pre-courses from August to September.

Then September came, and after a few completely demoralizing full-online weeks, in October, I had a very very severe personal and emotional incident, that I still haven't completely recovered from.

This, paired with 50% of lessons being online, led to me completely halting studying and laying in bed crying myself to sleep. A few months passed, and December came, when I had to give my first three exams: Calculus, Linear Algebra, and Programming.

I failed each and every one of them, even Programming; something that I'd been doing (as a hobby) for about 10 years. I knew that I knew much more stuff than some people who were only doing it since September, and yet, some of them got 30/30, while I got 9/30. I won't even talk about Calculus and Algebra as they were even worse disasters. 

Now, this clearly caused me to panic and made my fragile emotional status be even worse. However, I was recovering from the previous trauma, and so, after a full December and January of stress and failed exams (I tried each one twice; I failed Algebra and Calculus twice, and I'm still waiting for Programming's second results), I started the new semester full of positivity and good thoughts. ""This time, I'll always be attending lessons and taking notes, then instantly start studying as soon as I get home.""

Now, this is just the second week of the semester, and I'm already panicking. I've been doing the ""taking notes"" part pretty fine; however, there's a big underlying issue. You see - this semester's courses are Physics, Electrical Engineering, and Telecommunications. While I'm doing fine with the last one for now, after only two or three lessons of both Physics and EE, there are already vectors, matrices, linear equations, derivatives and integrals everywhere. Things that I only roughly remember from HS as I didn't really study for Calculus and LA in the first semester.

Now, even if I wanted - and believe me, I truly do want - I couldn't do it. I don't have the physical time to study both first and second semester's courses all at the same time. My idea was to give the three new courses' exams between May and June, and then re-attempt first semester in September - this way, I would be back to being in sync with lessons and wouldn't waste one academic year.

However, given that I'm already struggling with the new courses and I've just started them, I don't see how this could end well. I definitely won't be ready for June at this pace, let alone for mid-term tests, which my Physics prof. said are almost necessary to pass the exam. And I also have to consider that these new courses are much more fast-paced compared to first semester ones. Like - the sheer amount of information that I have to learn is huge compared to last semester.

So, here I am, asking for your help on how to handle this situation. What can one do? Is my whole academic career really completely screwed because I had a 2-months-long severe issue?

I know that taking one or two years more to complete studies is not too problematic, and I wouldn't worry too much in other situations. However, this was particularly important to me on a personal level; previously, I was even considering staying in University after the 5 years for a Master or PhD, which looks impossible at the moment - and I realistically know how other people would see me for taking longer to get there. The thing is: it really, really sucks to think that my future life and career - a lifetime of it - will always depend on those two months that I lost trying not to kill myself, as it was no something under my control and it couldn't have happened in a worse moment in my life. What the hell, why didn't it happen last summer? I wouldn't have minded staying in bed from June to September if I knew that the alternative was failing my whole academic career. What the hell, from my perspective, it feels like I'll have a constant reminder of this truly dark time for the rest of my life, and it's very sad and demoralizing, considering how difficult it was for me to get out of it and stand on my own feet again.

I'm sorry for the rant. I've come to Reddit to talk about this issue of mine multiple times in the past months and in multiple different subs, focusing on different stuff, but always deleted everything before sending as I was too sad to even want to think about it. I finally am getting over the emotional part, and I'm healing - but now this happens, and honestly I'm just losing my mind.

I'll be more than happy to remove this post and put it somewhere else if it feels inappropriate for the subreddit; I can understand that and I won't take it as a personal offense. Just tell me kindly and I'll kindly (re)move it.

Thank you all very much for listening and for helping me.

Looking for help! Optics Issue with Solar Energy Focusing Project in College,"Hey all. I'm a senior Mechanical Engineering student who's never really had to look into optics past Physics II until my senior design project this year, and I'm looking for ideas to solve a problem I'm running into. 

To give the TLDR of our project, we're harnessing solar thermal energy, and we need sunlight to be focused onto a small receiver. A Fresnel lens (approx. 1m^(2)) is attached to an arm assembly tracking the sun, and the receiver is a small plate on the top of a container. What we're seeing is that when light is shined directly above the lens onto the receiver, the lens focuses it in the way we want it to. However, when the light is shined not perpendicular, as in, the lens has rotated to track the sun's position farther down in the sky, the focal 'point' extends into some sort of ellipse as it connects with the receiver plate. Expanding the contact area is causing us to lose a significant amount of heat, and we'd like to have the focal 'point' be as small as possible regardless of sun rotation.

I've begun looking into the possibility of adding a second lens to focus the light once again, but with my limited experience with optics it seems as if the rays won't behave how I want them to and we'll lose a lot of energy.  At this point my team and I are going to begin exploring options other than the design we currently have because we haven't come up with a good solution so far. I'm hoping someone with more experience or knowledge in the field could help me come up with an alternative to pursue so that we don't have to integrally change our design.

How to keep up motivation for college,"Hey folks! Been having a tough time recently with college, but maybe not for the reasons you think. 

I am generally a person who loves learning and will happily read articles on cool stuff all day long or watch videos on interesting subjects. Unfortunately for me it seems that college has a lot of useless garbage alongside the stuff you actually need to learn to get by. 

Anyways, it's kind of been demoralizing to me to deal with it. This semester the only class I actually really liked was shockingly math, because I actually felt challenged. English is just me writing about myself while trying to reach a word count 5 times a day. Intro to Nanotech sounded compelling, but really it's just turned into buying the professors own text book and regurgitating it onto a sheet. Finally the most insulting class is my Diversity in Film class, where I get to spend money to be taught how the Lion King was actually racist in some manner, then write down the garbage as if I actually believe it. 

This is definitely a first world problem and I'm shocked at how affected I've been by things but it's tough to explain. I just feel bored and annoyed with all the busywork, and it makes me want to just get rid of college and do something more substantial. 

Anyways, how do I deal with this? I have seriously been considering just dropping out and doing something else but I don't see any other way to work in the space industry or nuclear industry which is where I'd like to go. I sure would love some advice.",AskEngineers,1646055528

What can I do about a company who doesn't train as a new graduate?,"Hello everyone,
I started a job right after university in march 2020. I was hired as a functional safety engineer in as a consultant in automotive domain. During my first month I was given a task of building MATLAB simulation, which is usually done by a software/system engineer. I was promised that I will receive all the support and resources if I get stuck and in the future I will be able to do more work related to my field (functional safety). As they don't have any more projects, that was the only task available for me. So I agreed to do it. The senior engineer who was responsible for it was leaving in a week. So they arrange two meetings with him. One for introduction to the project and another questions from my side. Since there was only one laptop with all the necessary software and tools. I was not able to inspect the model until the other senior engineer left the company. Once I started working on the project. I realized it was too complicated for me. I asked for help to the manager and was given info for a contact person from the other department. He initially agreed to work alongside me but once he saw the models, he refused to work alongside but offered to answer my technical questions. Fast forward in November, they get new project in the area of functional safety. They put me and a lead engineer in the project and asked me to divide my workload 50/50 on Simulations and the other project.

I was really struggling on the simulation project, every Monday we would have meeting with the customer. I was the only one responsible for the introduction/status/road map. Sometimes the customers had illogical requests/ too complicated questions. Due to lack of experience I wasn't able to push back on them and ready agreed to whatever they said. So the work load kept on increasing.

At the same time I was really enjoying working with lead engineer and learning lots of new things. But sometimes I missed the deadlines of the task due to work load from the simulations project. My manager expected me to takeover the safety task from the lead engineer within a few months. But I was not able to due to my lack of experience and also due to two tasks simultaneously. 

Last month they informed me that having two people work on the safety task was not profitable for the company and they are removing me from the project. The manager even mentioned me that he was not satisfied with my job in Simulation project, but assured me that my job is safe.

But slowly I have been losing interest in doing that Simulation task and the work load and meeting with customers is giving me anxiety. I feel like I will slowly becoming unproductive because the task is hard and no one is there to help. I am tried of asking my manager for help. Losing the safety project reduced my learning will and staying in the company.

I have already started looking for job. I am afraid, what if the new company is in the same way. Like they don't want to train you, just expect you to get the work done.

TLDR:- New graduate 2020, company hired for safety role and makes work as a software engineer. Doesn't train you and then blames you for low performance? Should I change the jobs ?

Do you always counter an offer you‚Äôve been given even if it‚Äôs more than you originally expected?,"I‚Äôm currently a l2 electronics engineer considering accepting a l2 systems engineer position with a defense contractor.

Any last hoorah things to do before graduating? (Also general advice),"I'm a M.E. student in my final semester set to graduate this summer. I  have a cGPA above 3.0 , 6 months worth of internship at a notable engineering company, a bunch of little projects, couple of competitions and a pretty interesting capstone project. However, I feel like my CV is pretty lacking to get into any company right now during the pandemic. 

1) I do know how to use a bunch of different engineering software and a couple of programming languages. However, I don't have any accreditation for them. Do I look into getting some certification for this? (i.e.: ANSYS, Inventor, Python, etc.)

2) I sort of loopholed my way through exams by studying for them the day prior. I have ADHD and as such couldn't really pay attention in most classes unless the professor was quite interesting. So my retention period of any of the information I studied is pretty much null. I do know the basic concepts of Calculus, Statics, Dynamics, Material Science and Thermodynamics but anything in-depth would require me to refer to my notes. I fear this could bite me when it comes to technical questions in interviews. How screwed am I?

3) I have already started looking into companies and am touching up my CV before applying through LinkedIn and directly. Any tips regarding this?

Would love any advice people can give. Truth be told, I am kind of burnt out of engineering in general (or perhaps studying) and would just like to slow down and work at something less intensive but still valuable on a CV.

Would you accept an offer from company that laid you off?,"About 3 years ago, I was laid off from a small manufacturing outfit due to financial troubles they were having. They told me they could only keep senior people and couldn't afford to keep me. Within a couple of weeks, I moved across the country and took a new job. I like my new company and they have promoted me twice in 3 years and I now make more than twice what I made at the first company. The job is a bit souless though, and I do a lot of admin stuff and I personally prefer technical side of things. I also dislike the location.

The old company has approached me 3 times since then. Once by my manager who is now in a more senior position, once by the new engineering manager and a week ago by the owner and the CEO of the company. First time, I didn't even ask about compensation and just respectfully declined. The old manager told me that one of the ""senior"" guys had died due to COVID and they had gone through 2 new engineers who could not keep up with the demands of the job. Then a couple of month later the new engineering manager approached me and said they were willing to pay whatever I am getting at the new job plus I could work remote and they would fly me in for customer visits and commissioning whenever needed. I still declined because I felt like the business is too unstable. Finally, the owner calls me and says he is willing to pay 20% over what I am making now. He said that after they let me go, they had a few customers who specifically asked for me on new projects and they can't find anybody with my skillset so my job will be secure for as long as I choose to work there.

I have not said no this time but I'm still not convinced. While I was working for them, the engineering team was reduced from a team of 10 to just 3. Most of the engineers were fired because the general manager of the plant was a dumb hothead who liked firing people for the smallest mistakes or for missing impossible deadlines by a day or two. Then business started to tank because of the tariffs and they let the rest of us go. It also concerns me that they have apparently hired and fired at least two more guys so I'm assuming the general manager is still making the same short signed moronic decisions. At the same time, 20% more is a lot of money and I don't think the GM can override the CEO's job security guarantee. It's also a more interesting job technically.

Why Isn't There More Organizing in the Engineering Fields?,"I have been wondering this ever since I started my engineering career over a decade ago.  Why isn't there more organizing in the engineering fields?  We hear about welders unions, service worker unions, police unions, but never an ""mechanical engineers"" union.  This of course applies to the US engineering career market.  


While I was an engineer, I would hear about my colleagues in Europe that had ""bank"" holidays and ask my manager why we didn't get them.  Management would shrug it off as ""those Europeans are so lazy they're always on vacation!"".  Made me really want to become a lazy European engineer!  I then would ask my colleagues how they managed to have their vacations days at all, and they were astounded that engineers don't typically have unions in the US.  


Later on when I went on towards management in engineering, I faced the same issue.  I had to let my engineering teams know that they had to unfortunately work through some holidays that either their colleagues overseas got off, or even parts of their own team that were unionized such as the technicians or production line workers.  When performance review time came around, I had to give raises to the unionized workers, but the engineers on my team had the message passed down from the executives that ""there was no money due to budget cuts"".  Of course, nobody believed this, and with a heavy heart all I could offer was the fact that I didn't find it fair either.

"Cars - Is it true that everything (Transmission, Engine, Brakes, etc) is controlled by a single computer?","I'm not sure whether or not to buy a modern vehicle. I've been reading about cases of sudden unintended acceleration and according to a lot of the testimonies, these people tried to put their car into neutral, it did not work. They also tried to shut the car off, or use the brakes, and that also did not work.

According to what I've read, this is because all of those systems rely on the computer, so if the computer goes 'berserk', it won't respond to the driver trying to put the car into neutral, turning it off, or using the brake, since there's no mechanical linkage it's just buttons or shifts that send an electronic command to the computer. If that computer goes haywire (ie tells the engine to go full throttle) and freezes, is it true that you cannot use the brake, put the car into neutral, or turn the car off, because the computer will not respond?

Chemical Engineer at I&amp;C or Software Career Intersection,"Happy Saturday!

Hoping to get some perspective from this forum as the title suggests, I am at an interesting yet exciting intersection at my career.

Straight - stay at my current job...work in operations for chemical company. Been here for over 5 years and honestly never thought I'd like it as much as I do, the caveat is outside of my current role I do not see much of anything else that interests me. I get to work on a variety of disciplines but ultimately I am 24/7 on call with no rotation and the only progression is more assigned assets, so more after hours support. I love my co-workers and my boss, but honestly I have not done anything but work these last 5 years and really there isn't much of a balance in it. I am constantly tied to the plants and get woken up at least 2-3 times a week, usually work an entire weekend 2-3 times a month. Not sure if I am convincing myself I like it since it's familiar, but I love digging into PLC logic, electrical diagrams and P&amp;IDs. I am also I heavy quantitative persona and this role has me as the company SME for process data analysis (from my undergrad background).

Left - offered a Design Engineer role in I&amp;C at a power generation company for their nuclear fleet, but based in corporate engineering. It is a 10% salary bump and 5% higher bonus (currently at 10%). Not technically on call except for ERO (but doesn't seem to the degree I am now). Seems like alot of design review and the manager assured me that it is not what I am dealing with currently, but I have my reservations...I don't want to have the similar work balance as my current job and be thrown into the fire like I was initially, it was a HARD first 2 years personally.

Right - offered a Software Engineer role at an applied research lab. 15% salary bump but no annual bonus. The work-life balance is awesome and I honestly don't mind putting in 12+ hour days occasionally to get projects complete, but the area is not somewhere I want to live (big college town, nothing outside of it). Never on call and I have always been good at numerical analysis and programming. Everyone I met there was really down to earth.

Microturbine with cold gas jets before the turbine,"The small blades on a micro-turbine are difficult to to cool from the inside. Thus I propose a static, but adjustable ring of holes to blow jets of cold air in front of them. Or better: Two rings: one from the inside and one from the outside. Of course this works better in a more radial turbine.

For this the radial compressor on the same shaft has pickup tubes. Tubes at equivalent angles are collected by equal length headers. They guide the loud ultra-sonic wave to the turbine where we feed the jets. The combustion chamber experiences a mean pressure loss due to the swirl  -- though a powerful injector may work without it. But we generally need to introduce a pressure loss for the main stream. Thus our small holes never suck in hot air, but push out cold air just in time for the blade of the tube to pass through.

Additionally, there are cold air films to separate the hub from the exhaust and on the outside to separate the cone form the exhaust. So somewhere we have a well insulated tube which carries cold air from the outside through the annular combustion chamber to the shaft. So annular-tubular.

The ring is rotated by the ecu to adjust for velocity of sound and air.",AskEngineers,1645882227

Insulating &amp; Venting Attic Causing Increased Snow Load - Cause for Concern?,"I'm located in Massachusetts, where there is a subsidized energy program for adding insulation, air sealing &amp; attic ventilation at minimal cost. So, I did it. 

Our house 1890 house went from effectively zero insulation/air sealing, with 2 box vents, and zero soffit vents for ventilation, to 16"" blown cellulose with 8 soffit vents and 6 box vents. Our attic has remained at ambient winter temperature all winter long, whereas it used to be much warmer due to heat leakage and minimal ventilation. This would cause snow to melt relatively quickly. 

Our house is a hip roof with a large bump out at a corner, which creates a large valley. Previously, our roof would shed snow fairly quickly due to heat accumulation in the attic. During the past two storms, we've accumulated significant snow on the roof, plus additional drifts from surrounding trees. At one point we during the last storm, we had upwards of 2 feet in the valley. Due to the roof geometry and large overhangs, I'm not able to reach anything with a snow rake. These now have me concerned.

I'm well aware that our framing is undersized, like most old homes.  Mix of 2x6 and 2x8's, with a 2x6 valley rafter spanning 12' connected to a 2x8 hip rafter which spans 18', plus supporting jack rafters off of the valley.

I got hired knowing I would be working on a new R&amp;D project that looked super interesting.  Shit happened and that cool project was postponed and I've been working on less interesting things, but have great mentorship and I'm still learning, but I'm not really doing any R&amp;D on new designs, working on old stuff.

Got a bit tired of this so when a recruiter reached out about a new job offer, I kind of fell into the trap and applied.  Did some interviews and the job sounds great (working on a bunch of new designs), but the location is far away (1h commute, 2h when counting return trip) and the pay is pretty much the same.  I'm open to moving to this new location, but I'd be moving in a year or two only so.

However, after voicing my dissatisfaction to my supervisor at work, he reassured me and told me he noticed it too and that my interesting project is back on track.  Now I feel kind of confused because I'm scared that after my interesting project is done, I'll be stuck doing more boring things.  This new job might be much more interesting, but I feel after only 6 months at my first job, it wouldn't be fair to not give it a proper try ...

4-hour Engineering test to get the job wasn't sure how to answer this question.,"So I just finished a 4-hour test for a company that said the test would only take 2.5 hours. The test consisted of 3 parts, the first being a simple assembly in Autodesk inventor, where I had to make the parts and assemble them from scratch using a drawing. The second was a construction drawing, where I had to basically read a blueprint for the roof of a building and draw it out in Autocad. Both of I didn't have a problem with it, and they gave me 2 out of the 2.5 hours to do it. However, things got a lot more complicated when I got to the math portion of the test, which ended up taking way longer than I was allowed.

Basically, they asked me to solve [this problem](https://imgur.com/a/tEPykDY) first, and I had to do it in the following steps:

1. Find the moment between A and B
2. Use the moment between A and B to calculate the stress for a FOS of 4
3. Find the moment between A and C
4. Use the moment between A and C to find the reaction force Rb
5. Use Rb to find Ra
6. Calculate the stress between C and D using the moment calculated in 3. (between A and C) Again, for a FOS of 4

I had 4 other problems after this as well, including finding the ultimate moment on a beam, the force on a bolt, the size a fillet needs to be to satisfy a FOS of 4, and an I beam problem. It definitely took me a lot longer to get the test done than what I thought was expected. They didn't even give me any formulas and I had to ask them to google them for some of the problems, but I'm beating myself quite a bit over it... I just graduated with my master's degree and I feel like these were undergrad problems, and I still have no idea how to calculate reaction forces by first finding the moment, since that's actually not something that I've seen before in college. Are all engineering tests like this to get a job?? I'm worried that I may not be cut out to be an engineer if I can't even do these simple problems...",AskEngineers,1645819420

Is a masters degree worth at this stage of my career?,"TLDR: Will doing a part time masters (and dropping work down to part time) boost my career prospects more than just working full time and gaining more industry experience.

I recently found at that my new employer is willing to pay for me to do a masters should I wish to do one, and im struggling to make up my mind as to whether it would positively benefit my career.

A little bit about me:

I am an electronic engineer with 2.5 years industry experience. I have a first class degree in audio engineering (i only did 2 modules in electronics and did an electronics based dissertation) and shortly after graduating I managed to land myself a junior engineer role at an electronic design consultancy where I learned a hell of a lot. At the beginning of this year I started a new role at a research institution that as an electronic engineer (not a junior/grad role anymore), that comes with a good salary and great benefits. The company is linked to Southampton university which is one of the top unis in the UK for electronics, and this is where I would do a masters if i chose to do it. The masters would be part time and I would likely have to drop my work to 3-4 days a week to fit it all in, obviously taking a pay cut too.

The reason I want to do one is sometimes I find a lack some fundamental knowledge that other people have due to my unorthodox career path, and feel that doing a masters would nicely tie everything together. However I have always said to myself that I dont want to do any further education unless it is going to benefit my career.

 The question im trying to answer is, is it likely that doing a part time masters over 2 years would benefit my career more than gaining 2 more years industry experience?",AskEngineers,1645783427

Vacation Mismatch Between Offer and Actual After Hire,"Recently started at a new company, and there's two vacation policies. Non-union gets 22 days PTO while union gets 10 days vacation and 10 days sick leave (but taking a half day doesn't draw down your balances if you're in the union). 

When I got the verbal offer from the recruiter, they mentioned 22 days of vacation, though it wasn't mentioned in the offer letter. I asked about union dues and to get the vacation in writing, and the recruiter sent 22 days in writing as well as the dues information (so she knew I was in the union). 

I checked with the union and the bargaining agreement is only a minimum, so they could offer me more if they wanted to. The way I see it, the recruiter made a mistake. However, a big reason I took the job was 22 days vacation is huge, and if I'm only getting 10 I most likely would've accepted one of the other offers I received. 

I'm meeting with my manager tomorrow to discuss this, but I'm trying to decide whether I should ask for and not compromise on the 22 days specifically of vacation (not PTO in the recruiter's email), in addition to the 10 sick days? Try and meet in the middle? I know they're obligated to give me the sick time no matter what because of the bargaining agreement so there's no chance I get switched to a PTO plan.

Basically, should I insist on the 22 days vacation knowing this puts me at a vacation+sick time total higher than even people with 25 years at the company?",AskEngineers,1645768316

Is ME for me?,"First, I hope this doesn‚Äôt end up being too long, but I feel as if background is needed to hopefully help get relevant answers.

I recently graduated with a BS in Industrial Technology with a concentration in Computer Technology, I was a computer science major before. Therefore my background is heavily based in coding, networking, and a bit of electrical. While all of these interested me at one point, as graduation came I realized I did not want to be stuck in front of a computer especially not with coding as I did not like designing the code.

After a lot of thinking, (but maybe not enough research, as I‚Äôm still unsure) I figured I would like working in the automotive sector doing design as I‚Äôve always enjoyed watching and helping my dad work on cars and I love the work of companies like GM and Rivian who are working to build reliable and sustainable EVs. However I found that with my current degree it would be hard to break into the field without being stuck in software so I began to look for ME jobs and ME grad programs.

Around the same time I received an offer from a ME job and an ME grad program. I accepted the job and deferred my acceptance into the program until next spring. For the past 3 months I went through intense and thorough training with a lot of it building up to prepare for a lot of CAD work which just reminded me of being back in coding classes, stuck in front of a computer, designing. I‚Äôve come to the realization that I just don‚Äôt like design when it comes to anything.

So with this information my question is in what ways and what sectors could I still be involved with the creation/design/betterment of automotives without having to be heavily involved in CAD or better yet, being more hands on? Also, with my current indecisiveness, should I hold off longer on grad school until I know exactly what I want to do or should I take the opportunity while I have it? It seems that I keep finding what i don‚Äôt like instead of what I do like and I‚Äôd hate to waste the money and time on a new degree just for it to be added to the list of things i don‚Äôt like.

HVAC Cooling &amp; Heating load design help needed,"We're a small farm (mushrooms) trying to design an efficient fruiting room design.  Since mushrooms need to breath (a lot) we need to refresh the room air up to 10x per hour.  Since we're in a northern climate, we have very cold winters and hot summers.

To this end, I've put together what I believe is a suitable solution using a water-to-water heat pump and a passive Run-Around Coil loop.

The problem is:  I have no idea how to size any of the coils, tanks, blowers or the Heat Pump itself.

I have a lot of experience in controls, but that won't help me here.

I'd like to consult with some pros about this and figured I'd start here since I do not believe I need anyone local (necessarily) to get the ball rolling so I can size and cost this project out.

What can a Engineering Student to do develop into an exceptional engineers?,"For context, I'm a second year Electrical and Computer Engineering Student looking for guidance. Sorry in advance for a long question. I figured for me to answer this question of mine, it is best to seek for help from engineers already in the field who have the experiences that I don't so here I am! **If you want to skip the story and go straight to the question I left the question on the last paragraph.**

I realized early on in my life the importance of what you aim for. What you desire further formulates your thoughts and actions and completely changes the trajectory of your life. I noticed that the disparity between the ""quality"" of students as learners and engineers are based on what they are aiming for. Some chase for grades while other chase for theoretical understanding. Though their results reflected in their GPA may end up being equal with 4.0, the quality and the difference in the depth of those students are astronomically different. Or at least that is what I have noticed. 

I'm currently working in a project based engineering team. While working with brilliant student engineers, I notice that there are few exceptional problem solvers that fundamentally approaches the problems differently and comes up with incredibly creative solutions and also able to visualize the system in their mind. I know that they got to that level not by mistake but its a result of their accumulation of certain approach to their life that led them to be able to be ""exceptional"" in this category which I greatly admire. I've learned that one of them has a incredibly deep understanding of physics which definetely is what contributed to his current ""status"". 

My goal in my life is to make an impact through engineering. I love being able to break down complex problems into simple solutions. I like following my heart and my heart is only greatly inspired by having grand vision and when I push my own boundaries. I would like to start a start up in area of electrified transportation few years after I graduate. Now I do not want this to be a na√Øve goal and end up as just a talk. I understand that for one to achieve those grand goals and ambitions, they have to have good foundations and be intentional with their approach that will allow them to be a person capable of reaching that goal. 

**(Question)** So here I am asking for guidance. Being in the industry and the experience engineer you are, what do you believe is the most important thing that a student in university can focus on that will provide them with the foundations to achieve the things that I aspire to achieve? I understand that now is a time for me to build the foundation. I want to be able to ask the right questions when I'm approaching academics, laboratory, internship during summer, and just all the experiences in my life that will allow myself to set myself up in the right trajectory. I'm willing to transform my lifestyle and everything for this system as this is my passion and I love learning. I know that depending on what you aim for, the viscosity of your time and how much you gain out of having the same experience will be drastically different. I would really love to hear some inputs on what you believe should be that thing that one should ""aim"" for after the experiences you have. I expect everyone to have different answers and just want to hear your perspective!

Engineers working for major defense contractors - what is your typical annual raise?,"Obviously base salary, level of engineer, seniority, profit sharing, etc. could all play a role in the final number, depending on how your company sets up their pay structure. So I recognize that there will be differences, just trying to gauge how other engineers in the industry are being compensated.

Been working for a major defense contractor for a couple years now but I've been pretty disappointed with their annual raise structure. They used to factor in 1. Merit/Job Performance (last year I was in the ""successful performer"" category) and 2. Market Adjustment. Last year my overall raise was 3.67%. This year was even lower, 3%. They also changed the raise structure this year but didn't provide any details on what gets factored into the equation. Sure, 3% has historically been the average salary increase for most jobs, but hear me out...

This past year US Congress passed the record breaking $768B defense spending bill (50% of which goes to defense contractors), inflation was at an all time high of 7.5%, and my company had their highest annual profit to date. \*Cue my stupidly optimistic thinking that my salary would go up\*. Given these facts, on top of the fact that our benefits/insurance premiums keep increasing and taking up a larger percentage of my paycheck, I was really expecting a better raise this year. Perhaps I am just naive, but idk, I am feeling a bit discouraged and let down. Probably preaching to the choir here.

Internal promotions are hard to come by due to all the bureaucracy of such a big company, so is job-hopping to a different organization every couple years truly the only way to get better pay? I like a lot of aspects of my current role, but sticking around doesn't seem financially sustainable.

So I‚Äôm moving within my company. I‚Äôm moving over to building services. This includes a lot more design and technical work which I‚Äôll enjoy a lot more hopefully. It‚Äôs also got some CFD and fluids work which is what I enjoyed the most.

Has anyone ever left a fulfilling job and regretted it (thinking of leaving national lab),"I graduated college over a decade ago, and could have written some of the posts I see frequently here. I thought my first engineering jobs were so boring and without challenge that I really questioned if I had been seriously duped into becoming an engineer. I hopped between big companies, small companies, and all different industries for 5 years and was routinely disappointed at how each of them might as well have been ""Office Excel monkey with a little technical flair"".

As a last ditch effort, I eventually got a job at a national lab and a Masters degree and have been loving it. It's the exact job I naively thought engineers did when I was taking physics in high school. I design electronics and write FPGA firmware and software. I work with physicists to make detectors and sensors resistant to high voltage and cryogenics and play with liquid nitrogen all the time. I'm not exaggerating when I say that in the last year I've worked on projects for quantum computing, superconductivity, collider physics, and more.

I (used to) travel around the world to install stuff and even give talks. The people are cool and laid back, in the pre-COVID lunchroom, you could easily start a debate about triple integrals or the Linux kernel. I feel like a professor with tenure who gets to pick what they want to work in, I can go days or weeks without my boss checking on me. My name is on scientific papers. I feel like I'm the Gordon Freeman or Otacon, the fictional characters I grew up with that made me go ""Woah, what are those people's regular jobs like""?

The only thing is that I sometimes feel like I'm doing careers wrong when I read this sub. People on this sub talk about ruthlessly switching jobs every 2-3 years to optimize your salary growth. They talk about not giving a minute over 40 hours in a week that you don't take back in another week. These are things I find hard to do at my current job. After reading the sub for a while, I did get a competing offer, and my lab matched it - it was a big administrative deal, it had to get signed off by the head of the lab because it was outside my official salary band with the years I have.

So here I am, in my 30s, making around $120k, and that's really unlikely to go up faster than the 3 or 4% yearly raises until I maybe get a promotion. I feel grateful that my job inspires me and gives me absolutely none of the existential dread I remember having earlier in my career and I seem to read about often on here. But on this sub, I read about people making a jump from 120k to 175k to 230k+bonus in like 5 years, and I wonder if it's worth it. I started paying attention to LinkedIn the past couple of months and recruiters are really hounding. 

I don't know if this sub has just given me FOMO and the grass looks greener, and I may end up sitting at an Office Space cubicle making more, but wondering what I'm doing with my life. On the other hand, it feels very weird to go against the consensus of a sub full of very rational people who generally converge on the most optimal way to solve a problem (in this case, maximizing salary). People at work lately have been talking about how much more you can make ""out there"" and questioning if we're dumb for staying. This may seem naive also, but the only position I could see myself in that gives me more intellectual satisfaction would be entrepreneurship. Like an Elon Musk type on a smaller scale (just used as an example, I don't like him), who has the resources to solve a problem in the way that they want. If I can get one of these 200k or 300k jobs people are talking about and sock away money for 10 years and then start a business, well that sounds kind of cool too. But I don't know if I could last in a boring job that long.

Has anyone been in a situation like this? Is intellectual job satisfaction the unshakeable best metric of whether you should stay or leave? Or could the grass really be greener?",AskEngineers,1645712434
What is it like to be a mechanical engineer (specifically in terms of product design/manufacturing)?,"Hi, I'm a student applying for uni this year and I just wanted some insight into what mechanical engineering is like in terms of product design/manufacturing? One of my top choices is product design (in an art school) but ME was also mentioned to me as a possible career as I'm someone who really enjoys problem solving and being creative. I know some mechanical engineers go into product design later and from what I understand, MEs in this field are mostly concerned with making a product functional, doing drawings to help manufacturing and whatnot while product designers are more concerned with things like aesthetics and ergonomics, but there's also some overlap between the two?? Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Anyway, please tell me anything and everything but if you want inspiration:

* What kind of tasks do you daily as a mechanical engineer?
* What are the best and worst parts of the job in your opinion?
* Do you have to be creative in your job? (obviously, I know the creativity needed in a job like this is not the same creativity you'd use in something like fine art)
* What's your salary like at your stage in your career?
* Is it a stable career?
* Where do you work (e.g. office etc)? (forgive me if this seems like a dumb question)
* What was it like to study in uni? (What scares me most about studying ME or engineering in general is the maths and engineering courses are all very heavy in maths. Not that I was ever bad at it, I liked the problems solving element of it well enough and I got top scores in my school-leaving exams having worked like a dog for them, but I'm told maths at that level is not a good representation of what maths is in uni.)
* What's the gender ratio like in your field? (I only ask because I'm a girl and I know it's a male dominated field, but there have been pushes to get women into STEM so I'd like to know if it's still that way or if it's changing. My cousin did engineering and told me her classes were 90% male.)

I'm leaning more towards product design, mostly because I've spent the past year doing an art portfolio that I need to get into the course I want and if I ever wanted to go back I'd need to do it all again, however I don't want to wipe my other options off the table either if I end up finding out I don't want that course after all. Where I am, if you get offered your top choice, all other choices you may have put down are cleared and you won't get another offer, so it really counts to put what you want at the top.

Thank you in advance!

Construction Project Management Dilemma,"Hey fellow engineers,

I have a construction project management dilemma. 

In a circumstance where the Contractor is outside the contract schedule (either self inflicted or due to issues with the consultants design) and the client asks for them to price out a change order for a piece of additional works - the Contractor applies a daily rate for ""schedule extension"" to complete the proposed works. Sure - it makes sense that they would need to cover their overhead for being on-site those additional days. 

In you experience, how is this rate typically calculated? I've asked a few colleagues and get a variety of answers. Is there a *right* way? In my case, there's basically no verbiage to fall back to in the contract.

You can break out the ""General Conditions"" section of the contract to a daily rate, but the Contractor is claiming their actual expenses far exceed this calculated value and therefor is not *fair*. It's not explicit in the contract that the general conditions may be used as a mechanism to price out potential schedule extensions.

If we ask the Contractor to break out their burn rate, we get a list of equipment and personnel based on daily rates from the contract schedule of values for changes and omissions. These rates are mostly hourly and are reserved for change order works (which this technically is). However, is it right to apply them as a ""daily rate"" when in reality much of this equipment will just be sitting there on standby?

I understand this is likely a negotiation but I would like know some guiding principals to deal with this situation more pragmatically moving forward.",AskEngineers,1645660312

Are turbocharged cars generally more or less fuel efficient than naturally aspirated ones?,"I get why turbocharged cars can make more power but I'm not really sure why people say they're more fuel efficient. These are some of the factors I've found that influence fuel economy for turbo'd 4-stroke gas engine cars:

Pros of a turbocharged car (for fuel economy):

- Can use a smaller displacement engine while still producing enough peak hp, which has less friction power losses than a larger engine, and is also lighter and smaller than a larger engine

- Can reduce(???) pumping losses by producing very high intake manifold pressures

- Can increase torque around a certain rpm where the engine is most efficient, so you don't have to wring it out to 7000rpm (where fuel efficiency drops off a cliff)

Cons of a turbocharged car (for fuel economy):

- Need a lower compression ratio, which reduces efficiency

- Higher cylinder temperatures, increasing likelihood of knock, so you have to retard the timing and decrease AFR (therefore running rich)


Is there anything that I'm missing? Given that so many cars are turbocharged nowadays, I assume that they must be more fuel efficient than N/A cars. Are they actually better for fuel economy or is this just a myth?",AskEngineers,1645655255

Took a job that pays really well but will probably make me miserable. Should I stick with it for a year or look somewhere else?,"Hi guys,

I recently graduated with a major in ME and got my first job. The job in of itself is interesting. It doesn't do much with engineering but is more about verifying systems and testing. There is a major factor that I was very conflicted about even before taking the job. It will require me to travel about two weeks a month to a customer that is in a mining area in the middle of nowhere.  

I talked to the manager and he said that I could try working there for a couple of months and see how I feel about the job. However, today on my first day I learned that we will be working night shifts and during the weekends when I am out there.

This came as a surprise because I thought we would be working there during the day. I have never done something like this and it is way above my comfort zone. I am about to turn 26 years old, alone and don't have much going on in my life and my brother is insisting that I need to push through this and bust my ass for awhile to gain life experience and leave my cushy life at home. He says that I should do it for at least a year but I am afraid that it will make me miserable being out there. The upside of course is that I will be making big bank.

What are your two cents about this? Would sacrificing a year really be that bad? I figure that if I stick through this for a couple of months I will eventually find my rhythm and realize it isn't that bad. On the other hand, I could just quit and find a cushy job.

Some fraction of that? Torque goes to infinity as rpm goes to zero, so I can't just assume that I need the torque when the shaft isn't rotating, but I would also think that that's where the maximum torque would actually occur (for example, if the prop got stuck in weeds and was suddenly slowed or stopped).

Two year ‚Äúgap year‚Äù after getting MS?,"Hi all. I need career advice and have no idea where else to go, as I don‚Äôt know many experienced engineers. I recently graduated with my MS - went straight from my BS to my MS. During that time I had 5 internships in various companies, an MS thesis, 3 years of undergrad research, and a 1.5 year senior design project for my BS. After I graduated with my MS, I took a ‚Äúgap year‚Äù teaching engineering at a university. I don‚Äôt do research as part of my role, but I am still finishing up a publication from my MS work. 

I‚Äôm really enjoying the job, but I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs a good idea to do long term. It doesn‚Äôt pay well, and if I were to lose this specific position it would probably be quite hard to get back into industry since I don‚Äôt do research. Because of that, I was planning to enter industry after my year-long contract ends. I was just told that I can extend my contract to two years, and likely continue onto a long term role if I wanted to after that. 

Would it be a bad idea to extend my contract for another year? Would two ‚Äúgap years‚Äù make it significantly harder to find a job in industry compared to the one that I already have? Part of me wants to take the extension because I‚Äôm genuinely happy at my job and don‚Äôt want to throw that away if I don‚Äôt have to, but I do want to make sure I‚Äôm not setting my future self up for failure.

Why Couldn't we buil a ecology friendly power plant where we make artificial gasoline?,"Ello dear engineers, through the last evenements of gasoline price being really expensive I asked myself about the question of why [read title]. I know that Porsh presentes a project about building a poweplant like that in Argentina, but I do not see any advances on that project and I know why. 

1. The cost of building a power plant as big as their is immense.

2. The transport is costly 

3. To make such an ecology friendly solution require renewable energy wich is primarly wind powered and expensive.

I came to that conclusion: Why don't we build such a facility here in Quebec, Canada, where our electricity is 97% renewable and where we eliminate the transport cost by a lot. 

We still have a problem about the cost of such a facility but why don't we start by a small scale facility?

E-Bike concept for high frequency AC,"Vague title, I know. I am designing an electric bike of sorts, more like an electric assist, and I think modern commercial designs are inherently inefficient. No E-Bike I am aware of takes full advantage of the rotation of the wheel perimeter to generate power. In fact, the idea of a generator on your bike is not common. Akin to [Tesla's high-frequency](https://www.lab-tesla.org/ee1891.html)[ AC generator,](https://www.lab-tesla.org/ee1891.html) I believe with the right configuration, we could use the high rotational velocity of the perimeter of the bicycle wheel to generate viable (relatively) high-frequency current. Ideally, this current would be used to power a synchronous motor that decreases the resistance of the wheel turning, and could also be used to charge a battery; this allows for an electric-assist mode and a fully electric drive mode. I've been thinking about which kind of motors would work best for these purposes. A brushless DC motor seems to fit the bill, but it seems a bit counterintuitive to rectify AC and then have it inverted by the BLDCM. I've toyed with the idea of using a 3-phase generator and a battery inverted to 3-phase to power a 3-phase motor, but this seems convoluted to me. I've also thought about just scrapping the synchronous motor idea and using an induction motor instead. A squirrel cage would at very least provide some rotation, but I question the efficiency of this as it is asynchronous and the rotation of the rotor would be locked with the rotation of the bike wheel/chain/gear. I would also prefer not to need a controller for the motor, but it wouldn't be the end of the world if the design ends up calling for one. This is a rough and loose idea at the moment so let me know what y'all think. I would appreciate any input.",AskEngineers,1645576380

Advice needed - Stressful Engineering Job!,"\*\*LONG RANT\*\* \*\*APOLOGIES FOR THE NEGATIVITY IN THE POST\*\*

Where do I even begin to describe my situation? I currently work at an F500 company as an entry-level design and validation engineer. This is my first job after graduating from grad school. My work hours were crazy until I made a decision myself to limit myself from working more than 50 hours a week. My team's design lead had to email everybody in the team to work only during the normal working time and not during nights and weekends, which is working I believe. At first, I didn't mind working long hours to get myself acquainted with the company and its various processes and systems, but it started affecting my mental health. The deadlines are extremely tight and the pressure is extreme to make things happen. My direct manager also left the company within a year citing health reasons, long hours, and high stress. 

Working from home and after \~7 months of joining the company, I still feel uncomfortable with my day-to-day activities. It mostly consists of giving updates on my components in system-level meetings. And I'm so busy gathering information for my updates, I just don't find the time to learn in-depth about the components that I'm owning for the product/ other essential skills like GD&amp;T, stackups, other analyses, etc. I feel like I'm flying blind sometimes. I don't even get the time to read standards/best practices. 

I also suffer from high anxiety and I'm currently seeking therapy and that is helping (it's been only 2 months since I started). I strongly think that my anxiety plays a huge role in my work and personal life, I hesitate to ask basic questions to understand better and feel like a non-contributor for my team. I mess up in planning and still do, as compared to my colleagues. My colleagues who are younger than me are much more organized and detail-oriented. My work so far is always a mess and I always feel like I will be fired tomorrow. I struggle with prioritizing tasks and collaborating with people on my team. I don't want them to think that they made a mistake in hiring me. 

I want to get better at my job and I am really looking for some guidance from veterans in this group. Thank you! I would like to apologize if the tone of this post is negative, but it has been on my mind for a long time.",AskEngineers,1645504664

1. They offered me the position with no interview simply based on my resume. I'm early career so I'm not at a place where I'm specialized / valuable enough to be just be offered jobs without an interview.

2. I asked to speak with the hiring manager for the position, which they kindly facilitated. The HM seemed great, but was unable to tell me which specific team I would be assigned.

Pump system: Hydraulic unit system 

Inlet reservoir: 2l

Dimension: approx. 800x850x1500 mm

I am looking for somebody to give me an idea of which parts to find and advise me on the main components to build such machine. I understand the functioning of the machine, however I could not find a detailed assembly plan online. 

Regarding the websites to find the parts I have already checked McMaster, Misumi and others. I am from Europe and therefore reducing transportation costs would be a big plus. If anybody could advise me on where to look for affordable spare parts that would be awesome.

Has anyone ever left a very small company?,"I currently work as a hardware / firmware engineer at a very small company (4 people).

My boss (the owner of the company) has joked that he wishes he had two of me. I suggested he hire another engineer and I got laughed out of his office. He said we don't have the money to bring on another full time engineer. I also have to constantly remind him that I am only 1 person.

1. Characteristic curves of machines. Flywheel and its effects. Fundamental equation of rotating systems
2. Balance
3. Vibrations
4. Vibrations analysis


We are currently on the first topic and we are learning to get the start time of a engine (which is, as it's described, the moment where the engine gets to its nominal angular velocity [œâ0]) by plotting the characteristic curve of the engine against the curve of the load or vice-versa. To plot one of them in the other one we need to correlate each other through the gear ratio ( n = œâs / œâe ) and the efficiency ( Œ∑ = Ps / Pe ). You can see one such diagram here: https://imgur.com/a/jEDjuFP. Here, the engine curve is Mm and the Mc is the load curve but related to the engine through the gear ratio and the efficiency. Where these two curves cut each other is where the nominal angular velocity is.

Not sure if you guys have seen a weed house, but there are large ventilation pipes that they put through the ceiling. This left large holes in the floors and ceilings. 


To repair the ceiling, a metal sheet was placed to completely patch the hole, then wood was put over the whole ceiling to enable the plaster to go on, because without it the house was too damp for the plaster to stick.

The joists have welded right-angle flanges at the ends. The flanges will rest in slots cut into the concrete/limestone walls of the garage.

The builder just delivered the material and it looks like mild steel. Each joist is in two parts, one sliding inside the other, so it will be extended in-situ to precisely span the gap from one wall to the other, and a central bolt on the outer joist will be tightened to press onto the inner joist to stop it from sliding after installation.

I've been advised to paint the outside of the steel to stop it rusting. My concern is the inside of the square hollow section. Won't it be exposed to air and therefore rust? I can't possibly paint the inside, the beams are 3 meters long and section is about 10cm x 5cm so barely big enough to insert a hand.

The end flanges don't completely seal off the hollow section at the extremities, so air can still enter. So, should I be concerned about rusting? Wall thickness is about 5mm - how many years would it take for rust to appreciably weaken it? I'd estimate storing about 300kg of stuff on this structure. There are 4 joists in total.

Is there anything I can do to protect the interior? Should I try sealing the ends to the concrete walls with silicone (once installed) and put extra paint or silicone on the joint between the inner and outer beams to prevent air entering as much as possible? Or does that trap moisture and make the problem worse? I enquired about galvanising but that's not an option post-covid",AskEngineers,1645382134

I am thinking something like putting them in the vacuum chamber with the lid unfastened so the air can get out, evacuating the chamber, then repressurizing quickly so the lid gets sucked against the container.

For context: we sell semi-prepared meal kits online, which uses a ton of plastic packaging. I am looking into circular packaging options like reusable containers, but the reverse logistics is looking like quite a pain.

Community &amp; Social work - searching for jobs around the world,"Hi folks, 

I will soon finish my Bachelors in environmental ingeneering with specialisation in hydraulic/coastal engeneering and geotechnics.   
Now I would really like to apply what I have learned in a organisation/company in the community/civil sector. Connecting districts to water supply/waste water disposal, waste disposal in general, agriculture projects (soil and water) or improving living standards in other way crossed my mind. 

I found the ""development service"" in Germany provided by the GIZ or other organisations. The problem there is, that they need professionals with experience and no rookies \^\^'... I am not that arogant to say about myself that I could complete this leading position rather be part of the team.   
The country does not matter, more the project itself. I made accounts on serveral websites (for jobs, internships, and so on...) but I believe locals know much more :) 

**My question to our holy reddit community is now:**   
Do you know an organisation/company/movment in your country which is working in the social engeenering sector with striving to improve in a technical/constructive way the living standards in neglected areas?   


**To summarize some more details:** 

Education:   
\- B.Sc. environmental engeneering (specialisation in water and soil)   
\- languages: german, english, spanish (A2), portugese (A2)   
\- one year volunteer service in India, in a school   
\- ArcGIS, Revit experience

\- full time/half time   
\- **payed internship**   
\- environmental protection programs  
\- work with technical share  
\- project limted work

How do microwave ovens power scale and is there a way to use/mod a microwave with bad power settings to better control it?,"I recently replaced my microwave with a rather cheap model (as budget allowed) and unfortunately it's power control is not very good.

As far as I can tell if I use the power level setting on it, it's using bang bang control with a timer. EG: On half power it does full blast for like 10s and off for 10s. 

Given the way my old microwave behaved, I believe it did this too but was also able to adjust the output to some degree. Bang bang with some power scaling so it's not just full blast.

The results are rather disappointing because I would often microwave meat on low power to defrost or warm it without overcooking the edges. Now even at half power I can hear it sizzling during the periods when it's blasting.

I guess I have two questions:

1) Is my understanding correct or are there other factors in power distribution?

2) Is there any way to use this piece of crap by adjusting settings, position of food inside or modding the controls to make it more versatile?

After a bit of struggle, I finally got an admit at a public university in Germany - Masters for ""AI for robotics"" course. I really love the course structure and I am super excited to start my studies in this March.

But I am afraid about getting a job/internship in Germany as they value experience over a college tag. I have almost 2 years gap in my resume. I dont know what to do.

Asking for a promotion after telling my boss I want to switch departments,"I've been working at a large Aerospace/Defense company for 2 years after graduating college. I work as a Safety Engieneer, which has been identified as a critical skillset at our company. Currently we are set to have only 2 senior engineers with this skillset at our location once older staff retire soon. We are DESPERATE for more people and we have been struggling with this for years. A couple of months back, there was an opening in a new department and I jumped at the opportunity because I wanted to expand my skills. Luckily, I was in a rotational program for recent college grads so my department couldn't really interfere with me leaving. I technically could have left a year earlier. 

The transition to the new department is set to happen around May of this year. At that point I will have 2.5 years of experience (3 if you count my internship at the same company). In order to get promoted to the next level, you usually need 2.5 - 3 years of experience. I feel my best chance of getting promoted is within my current department. They know my work. They like me. If I were to start over new at a different department, I would face a big learning curve and it would likely take longer to prove myself and earn that promotion. I want to ask for a promotion and get it by May but I feel like I have shot myself in the foot by signaling that I want out of this department soon. 

Is there any way I can convince my department to promote me before handing me off to the new group? I have a meeting with my manager next week to discuss goals for the year and I want to come prepared with a case for my promotion.

The things I have going for me are:
-Proven good performer in a critical skills area that my department is desperate for
-Enough years of experience to be promoted to the next level
-I neglected my rotational program and stayed with my group a year longer than I was supposed to in order to help them out with all of the work they needed help with
-I have the most experience in a wide variety of programs and their lifecycles out of all of the junior engineers in our group
-I could interpret their decision to NOT promote me in that timeframe as an indication that their department doesn't look out for their own and therefore there is no reason for me to rejoin

Is there any way I could leverage any of this in a professional manner for a promotion before they allow me to leave for a new group?",AskEngineers,1645245512

"I still love space, but after 5 years in Aerospace contracting, I don't know where to go","Hello,

I am 5 years into my job (thermal analyst) at one of the prime aerospace/DoD contractors. Most of the time, the work has been slow and I feel a lot of what I have to offer (presentation skills, communicating engineering concepts, systems-thinking) isn't being exercised. 

&amp;#x200B;

That said, the past 2 years have been really good-- I worked a program where those exact things were being exercised. It was a recently conceived program, so the work was highly developmental, innovative, and ""out there"". I was thermal lead for the program, and worked closely with all the other disciplines (e.g. materials, structures, aerodynamics, etc.). We all worked together in a small room, hashing out ideas and drawing on the whiteboard. It was like working in a startup, with the security of working for a big corporation. 

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway, that program is gone. The customer is no longer funding it. So 2 years of work... poof. 

I am basically back to being a level 1 (I am a level 3), sitting at their desk doing nothing as I await a new assignment. I am just disillusioned that my company just goes with the flow of government money, and doesn't actually have a vision or invest in IRAD. 

&amp;#x200B;

Most of the work here, besides refurbishing 50 year old tech, just doesn't seem real. Most of the programs don't get off the ground; no one wants to fund them (and understandably so, given how horribly inefficient my company is). Nothing here seems to fly or go anywhere. 

&amp;#x200B;

I love space. I want to keep working it. But I am really sad about the possibility of 40 years going by and nothing I worked actually flying in space. 

&amp;#x200B;

Any advice? Would a smaller company be better? For someone who likes being in front of the customer and likes exercising systems thinking, what would you recommend? Analysis is obviously important, but I don't want to be in a cube running analyses my whole career.

Mechanical vs Mechatronics: current KSU student,"Hey y'all, so I'm currently an undergraduate engineer at Kennesaw State University as a mechanical engineering major.

Observation made in 1986 in sky over Kwajalein Atoll of who knows what?,"In 1986, I was working at Kwajalein Atoll on Star Wars (SDI) and was watching the arrival of test warheads dispatched from an ICBM launched from Vandenberg AFB in California. This was routine. A Russian electronics trawler was 7-miles offshore, also routine.

After the re-entries, I looked straight up into the sky to see what was up there. I am a star gazer, this was natural. But I saw something odd. It appeared to be a shooting star, yet it took two left-hand turns and disappeared at the point it had started at. The path it traced was of an equilateral triangle and it occurred in a small arc of sky, perhaps each side of the triangle was the length of Orion's Belt.

I've little idea about what this could be. The sight was unusual and the timing coming at the same time as test re-entries... well, was the space activity being hidden behind a seemingly routine mission that was used as a decoy?",AskEngineers,1645210501

How are things that are way too big to fit on a truck transported to their destination from the factory/foundry?,"Of course, assuming both the factory and the destination aren't adjacent to the sea, that would make it a lot easier. One example would be very big gantry cranes, which have single parts that look too big for any road transport, at least on public roads. Or some huge machinery in factories also seem to have parts(like huge blocks or structures) that seem to big for the roads, and they seem like genuine single parts, not a welded together part. Do they actually establish a foundry/machining workshop in the factory and forge and machine those huge parts while the factory is first being set-up? Maybe that's feasible for some applications, but others(like huge gantry cranes outdoors) not really. The examples can be multiplied, like propellers and shafts of big ships, very big metal pipes etc. And assuming the forgery/foundry/mill/factory doesn't have a port of it's own for sea transport, nor a railroad for rail transport.",AskEngineers,1645209231

Take a senior role whilst young or develop in current role?,"i'm stuck in a bit of a (good) dilemma. I graduated from my Masters in 2019 and worked in a graduate role (¬£26,500/$36,000) from 2019-2021. I received excellent feedback, developed really well and fell in love with the industry.

The company I worked at, at that time had a recruitment freeze - so I moved to another company for a significant promotion (from graduate to mid-level) I've been in this role for 6 months (¬£37,500/$50,000). I find the work manageable, but a little boring and very political. I could easily stay here for a few years though without any issues.

Now my old company is hiring again, and after applying, just to see more than anything, I have received an offer for a senior engineer role (¬£51,150/$70,000). This comes with a ¬£15,000 ($20,000) salary bump as well as responsibility increase. Obviously I'm happy - but my concerns are:

As I'm not currently chartered, will working under more pressure/more intensely affect my ability to become chartered?

I need career advice,"Hello everyone. 

One year ago, you help me choose if I should've followed a PhD in composite materials part-time. (Working full time as a R&amp;D design engineer)

I've now started it, and I'm enjoying it tons. I am now in need of a career advice. So here are some bullet points:

* I am a young graduate (1.5 years of industry and 1 internship)
* My first position was 1 year at a UAV startup, I designed some drones, in which we had components in composite materials.  
* Started my PhD in composite materials in September

&amp;#x200B;

* I left the startup , in September, (I was invited) for a consultant job as a Design Mechanical Engineer in a big consultant/contractor. I've had some performance trouble and difficulties adapting (I got no training nor guidance. I was just thrown into the problems of our clients). I believe the people who hired me had better expectations. However,  I am now getting used to my position and I believe performing way better. 

&amp;#x200B;

* I left the startup because I was the most experienced engineer (we were 3 graduates), building a  20K-60K drone. Even though I loved composites,  I always had to work 10-12 hours, every day, studying to understand even the most basic stuff because I had no one to help me. 
* The work environment was great, but I was always receiving critiques on my work from non-technical people because ‚Äúit was not pretty‚Äù or that ‚Äúwe could sacrifice performance for the sake of aesthetics‚Äù. 
* Nobody cared about my opinions about my own job, and I was always on the defensive mode. Even though I loved composites, there was no growing and learning here. I really stopped believing in the dream, as I never cared about drones.
*  Additionally, they asked me to do stuff that went against my professional ethics, which I refused. 
* Oh, and the pay was shitty because it was a startup (not a problem because I really enjoyed the project, because of the composite materials).  Don't forget I was a fresh graduate.

&amp;#x200B;

Been 6 months on my new job, but I've been trying to go back to composite materials design again. In my country, there aren't many opportunities. 

I've had 3 interviews, in the composite design field, and the most complex questions that I've to answer are:

* Why did you left your old company if you loved composite materials?
* Why didn't you apply for composite materials and are now working an R&amp;D engineer in machine design?

The skills that I use in my new job are similar to my old job: FEA, 2D drawing, 3D modelling, etc etc. My consultancy company told me that in the future they will put me in Composite Design positions, but I don't believe so. 

Is too late to go back to composite design materials? If not, what do I have to do to enter this position again? I'm already doing my PhD to learn the most as I can about the subject. 

Also, I am afraid that changing jobs only after 6 months is bad for my resume. I also think about what it might tell about me as a person: can't I be satisfied? What if I change jobs again, and I can't stay? 

Or is this just bullshit that companies tell you so that you don't ask for better benefits? Should I really try to invest in my consultant job and try a few years later again in composite design positions?

Sorry if it's confusing, but I am confused as well. I just hope I haven't destroyed my opportunities to work in composite design again, but I also don't want to burn my CV. 

However, I am very grateful for having a good job in R&amp;D (which is what I love) and having the opportunity of doing my PhD as well. I am aware that I am very lucky to be in this position.

Private consultancy -&gt; state transport authority - 6yr geotech engineer (AUS),"I've been working as a geotech for 6yrs mainly in infrastructure and a little land development. I've got a good breadth of experience under my belt (investigation, design, reporting, PM, construction services) and have had the chance to work on nationally significant infrastructure. Currently working with a large multinational and have worked in similar companies for the last 5yrs.

Just had an interview with the state transport authority, and it went well. The role is internal technical advisory so I would be doing the same kind of work as I would be doing in a private consultancy, but I'd be working 'client'-side. I'm excited about the role mainly because of the job stability and benefits (flexible work hours, hybrid WFH, 35hr work week + paid overtime). It would also pay well.

The ad appeared online with good timing as the major project I'm working on is winding down, but between applying and getting the interview, I've been tagged to move onto a very interesting tender design that's got my nerd juices flowing. The infrastructure pipeline in our state is massive so the industry outlook is very positive for the next 10-15yrs. Every engineering company in infrastructure is working at or near capacity.

I have doubts as to whether I can be as engaged with and interested in the work. On paper I'd be working on the same projects that I am currently delivering to the state so you wouldn't think engagement would be a problem.

Now: is it really necessary to build them that way, especially when they have circulating air? It just seems like a huge waste of energy and a nuisance (preheating, lots of extra heat in your flat during warm weather). Is the heating element in front of the ventilator just way too weak to heat all the air in a short period of time, assuming you'd remove all of the heat reservoirs, leaving only the structurally necessary, high heat capacity elements you couldn't get rid of?

graduating without amazing internships,"hey guys, i'm set to graduate from mechanical engineering next spring and will be completing my fifth and final internship of my undergraduate career, however I'm really worried about job prospects and general happiness post graduation. All the internships I've worked at haven't been crazy design experience or at prestigious companies, and they dont really connect to each other. I am hoping to get into automation/controls and/or design positions but have only gained 'exposure' to these fields rather than made actual contributions. I've already accepted an offer for my summer internship, but its really not an amazing position (its mainly CAD editing and general intern bs, not like I'm designing the systems itself). To be completely honest, I accepted because its location would allow me to stay home and cut costs so that I can save to travel/enjoy my summer. I'm afraid this choice will negatively affect my job prospects post graduation because typically students at my level are aiming super high. I've always felt inferior due to this but after some shitty past interviews with these huge companies, I was really nervous about aiming high for this summer.  I also generally want to treat engineering/my career as a means to fund my other passions in life, but I feel like this lowers my value as an engineer when looking for jobs, and I'm not sure whether this is the right attitude to have at this stage in life.

How to think about mass and dynamics in a scale model,"Trying to wrap my head around this, it's proving a fun challenge.

Suppose I have a scale model of a structure I want to build, at 1:10 scale.

The reason I have this model is to understand how the real structure would behave with regard to how and where it bends, distorts, how it behaves in general.

Suppose the structure has a volume of a known mass at full scale. When I scale down the proportions, is the correct way to interpret how the mass changes,  to simply scale the linear dimensions, recalculate the volume, and derive a new mass via the new volume combined with the original density?

This seems weird but a thought creeps in, that if the goal is to consider how a material will behave at by creating a shrunken version of it, that you would in some respects want to densify the matter as you shrink the scale. 

But the I get back to the concept of intrinsic and extrinsic properties.

If density is intrinsic, then when I scale dimensions, I go through the cube/square situation, but at the end, I can treat density as something that functions the same at any scale.
More to the point, properties like stiffness, or should we say modulus of elasticity, stay the same at all scales save down to a couple atoms.

I think, to distill the essence of this question, if you make a scale model to investigate the dynamic properties of a structure, can you make your model out of the same material as the full scale and thereby accurately model the dynamics, or does the mass need to undergo a transition of it's own to model those dynamics in miniature.",AskEngineers,1645163395
What are some good questions to ask a Mech Eng/old colleague about the company they work for that you are considering employment at?,"**TLDR AT THE BOTTOM**  
\---  
**So some background...**

* Have been contemplating a new role/company for a bit now
* I work for a large fortune 500 company in the the Automotive sector currently.
* I've been a design engineer here for 4 years (previously associate design engineer for 2 years at the same place)
* I got one raise/merit increase one year after being in my DE role before merit increases were cut from budget due to covid, so I have been stuck at this salary (we were given some vesting stock options as an HR gimmick for employee retention during covid)
* My projects have grown to the scope and complexity of senior level work without pay adjustments
* I have been pushing my boss, my boss's old boss, and now my boss's new boss to look into salary negotiation without success

Recently a recruiter/director of HR for a small (maybe mid sized) company reached out to me via text about a Sr. DE opening that pays 95-115k a year. They're a supplier of automotive parts for various auto companies...

As it turns out my boss's old boss (a chief engineer) who recently left the company, now works for this new company as VP of Engineering as of 3 months now, and noticed my name on a list of potential candidates and recommended he (HR) reach out to me. *(He mentioned my colleagues name in one of the texts so I did some research to make sure it was the same guy who left my current job... and sure enough, it was).*

So I reached out to him (we weren't incredibly close, but I've spoken with him in person a few times) on LinkedIn to verify the recruiters story was earnest... I asked him if he'd be willing to meet up **so I can talk with someone more candidly** about the company, rather than pre-canned answers from HR in an interview. We meet this Wednesday

*I've been considering moving over to purchasing too (since I also have a supply chain/business degree) for a small pay bump and also to get out of the mental fatigue and complexity that engineering places on me at times, as I'm not sure I want to continue down the technical path to senior........ But I make 75k now and 95-115k is hard to ignore. Also, my current project is very complex, and I know very well my boss and my boss's boss do NOT want to use me, so could also potentially use a job offer as leverage for salary negotiation.*

**tl;dr - What would be some good questions to ask an old colleague about their new job/company I'm contemplating a Sr. DE role at about:**

* **The company**
* **The product**
* **The culture**

Master's degree for systems engineer?,"Hello Reddit. I have a Bachelor‚Äôs in mechanical engineering and am working as a systems engineer. I would like to pursue a technical Master‚Äôs degree.

I do not want to study systems engineering as I would like to study something that is more in-depth technically. I also don‚Äôt really want another mechanical degree as I would like to expand my technical knowledge.

I am interested in working in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) and implementing the tools/software to model the performance of large-scale systems. I have worked a little bit in MBSE tool development and enjoyed it. The largest knowledge gap I encountered was on the software side and the actual implementation.

Because of all this, I was considering either computer science or software engineering. Thoughts? I had also considered electrical engineering but in hindsight I don‚Äôt really think it would be relevant.

ASME Y14.5 Requirements and implementation question.,"One of my engineers at work and I have been discussing the proper use of GD&amp;T for a couple months now on and off.

If I were to dimension say a flange with a bolting pattern and leave any datums and feature controls off of the drawing, would I be in violation of Y14.5.

It would seem to me (working in a small machine shop making 'one off' parts for test fixtures) that more time would be spent calculating things such as bonus tolerance and what not than to just say... Oversize a screw clearance hole or template from a mating piece, or spend a few extra seconds dialing in the machine tools.

Can you guys give cost estimates/rule of thumb/heuristics for understanding when is each more betterer? 

I currently hold the view that LRT makes no sense because laying the rail is expensive _and_ inflexible in short-term (you cannot reroute LRT) nor long-term (you cannot change routes to accommodate city changes).

It is essentially the ability to create a custom case for a piece of equipment (I would like to keep it a secret but let‚Äôs say for example a case for a guitar)  that sort of length, but thinner. There is nowhere online that offers the ability to specially design and customise a case and have it created for a specific person so it is unique.

My question is how would I manufacture this?

Would it be easier to find a supplier in China that do basic cases, ask if they‚Äôll do custom and then work with a designer on fiverr to mock-up a design for the manufacturer? 

Or order blank cases and somehow print the designs on myself? (Again, I don‚Äôt know what software / technique would be best for this)

Or should I try and create them myself? Would this be 3D printing? Or perhaps injection molding? 

Ideally the cases would be made from plastisol or leather, would obviously need to be hollow on the inside and need to be durable to withstand, wear, the elements etc

If I'm being 100% honest though, business does nothing for me. I'm not passionate about it and the only reason I really chose it was to just tick the ""I have a degree"" box. Also, I'm very very passionate about aviation and have always wanted to become a pilot but am unable to due to mental health reasons and a speech impediment. I chose business at a chance of working on the management side of aviation.

Recently however I have been considering aeronautical/aerospace or civil engineering as it seems like it's essentially the next best thing to becoming a pilot as it allows me to work with aircraft (albeit not flying them) and airports (civil). But I'm worried I will regret doing it as a degree, and that I'd find it is nothing like I had hoped i.e boring, not as hands on, etc. I didn't do physics in high school and only did standard mathematics in Year 12 and fear I may struggle grasping basic concepts involving physics and advanced mathematics.

Regarding Truss - Moment Equilibrium Direction,"I'm fairly new to this whole truss problems but have been able to understand the essence of virtual work in place, however what I can't understand the moment if a structure has a vertical component and some force (point load) acted perpendicular to it (disregard sign convention), why do we map that vertical component's moment with its height (y axis) rather its length (x axis) **(1) and vice versa**, even so shouldn't we solve for a ""lever arm"" so essentially square root ( a\^2 + b\^2) \* cos theta **(2)** \- in order to find the normal force and have that be the moment or am I misunderstanding something here?

Getting a mining job in australia 4 years after graduating? -seeking advice how to get a foot in it,"Hi all, long time reader, first time poster

So i graduated with a chem eng degree in 2019 from curtin, and to be fair my work history is a bit patchy.
For around 17 months i worked as a junior project engineer on the prelude flng project (got laid off due to covid as i was unable to travel due to border restrictions). 

I applied for a grad position at my current company, but got rejected due to having too much experience, hence they told me to go into a proper project engineer role, but none of them would take me on, so got offered an engineering coordinator position, which i took as a means of ""getting my foot in the door"" to eventually get a project engineering job. Unfortunately there is shit all growth in my role and i believe my career progression has stagnated. Im in a position where i feel after 3 years of post grad experience that I cant offer too much to an employer.

Looking for an explanation and a solution to a weird pressure (?) issue between two rooms that causes cold air to enter one and turn it into the arctic.,"I own a restaurant in a rather warm city but our dining room feels like Antarctica sometimes and I think it is mostly due to the pressure/wind from one room to the next. Part of me wants to understand it just to know but I also need to fix it. There are two rooms in this equation. The ""Interior Dining Space"" and the ""Patio Room"". And two main doors ""Main Entry Door"" and ""Patio door"".

The Interior Dining Space is the first room you would walk into upon entry of the business. There is the main entry door (pretty well shielded from wind entering) at the front of this room. Upon entering through the main entry door immediately to the right is a door that leads to what we call the Patio Room. There is another door in the interior dining room space further inside and along the same right wall as the  the door that led to the Patio Room and a swinging door in the back of the Interior Dining Space which leads to the kitchen although I think these doors are mostly non related to the issue so I won't mention them further. 

&amp;#x200B;

The Patio Room  is a square room, fair to say it is to the right of the Interior Dining Space. The Patio Room has a ceiling and walls on its East and West sides, however, on the North and South sides it is almost entirely open to the outside world. The south side we have installed a retractable barrier which we leave down on cold nights which acts as a sort of wall. There are strong ceiling heaters in Room B, those, coupled with the barrier, leave the room nice and toasty, I could mention now that the heat in Room A doesn't work all that well. The patio door is on the west side of the Patio Room (and leads to Room A). This Patio door is poorly shielded from wind, having about 1/2inch gaps on all sides of it. This is a swinging door which swings both ways (into room A or Room B). 

Both room are relatively small - thin 40 feet by 40 feet square rooms each.

So.... The patio door between the Interior Dining Space and the Patio Room is always partially open into  the Interior Dining Space direction. This seems to happen no matter what - people inside or not, heaters on or not, business hours or fully closed, hot or cold nights (pretty sure), etc. The door opens in the direction of Room A because of a SUBSTANTIAL amount of wind rushing through and into the Patio Door. I put my hand in the gap the wind creates and am always amazed by how much wind seems to be rushing through on what is an insanely calm day. When pressing the Patio Door open (going from Room A to Room B) it takes a surprising amount of force to overcome the wind. Its not like difficult to open or anything, just a surprising amount of force compared to what you'd expect. 

&amp;#x200B;

So... that causes Room A to feel very cold especially in certain seats where I suppose the wind just flows towards more than others. What is weird is even if the Patio Room is very nice and warm, the wind rushing through it will cause the Interior Dining Space to feel equally cold all nights, it doesn't seem to care how warm the Patio Room is. 

&amp;#x200B;

Today I was looking at the door with a server and talking about how to fix it and I felt nobody was as shocked as I was with how intense the pressure/wind issue was. The server explained it makes perfect sense as the wind rushes in from the North opening in the Patio Room, can't escape through the South opening due to the barrier, then the wind is forced to the Patio Door and presses it open. As soon as she mentioned this.... someone came in and opened the Front Door in the Interior Dining Space and once they did, the Patio Door stopped being forced open by the wind/pressure and acted like a normal door. 

Maybe I sound like an absolute moron spoiled by living in the most pleasing weather in the country, and maybe this is a common thing in more places than I know, but I still find it interesting. I feel pretty confident that it is a pressure issue between the two rooms, but I would love to understand why. I don't believe it is related to temperature, is it simply due to the odd structure of the Patio Room? 

I have some very obvious lists of things to do to rectify this issue. Improving the heating in the Interior Space. Sealing off the edges and perhaps making a stop for the Patio Door. I think I am just curious if anyone more familiar with the outcomes of simply sealing off the Patio Door. Would that lead to any dead zones/cold spots in the Patio Room? Is the solution that simple or is there more I need to take into consideration here? 

My apologies if this is a painfully obvious questions, I seem to be more entertained by the situation than most.",AskEngineers,1645074062

Does a change in modulus change the resulting stress?,"Hello,  I am a working engineer and I am finishing my master's degree about now-ish. I have been working on a thesis that revolves around the material properties of composites. I had a bit of an argument with my advisor today that went like this:

Me:  ""I can show an increase in the transverse modulus. The laminate doesn't show much of a change in stress under the same loading condition.""

Advisor:  ""That doesn't make sense, you made a mistake in your CLT programming, go find it.""

Me:  ""I have looked and cant find any mistakes. I think it makes sense because the modulus doesn't really contribute to stress as much as \[a  list of other factors\].""

Advisor: ""Think of Hooke's Law, of course it does! Think of a tensile test!""

Me:  ""In a tensile test we measure strain and we know the input force and geometry of the sample... so if the modulus is increased then we should expect the strain to decrease. The affected quantity should be the stiffness/deflection if the modulus increases, not the stress.""

Advisor: ""Your absolutely wrong (approaching yelling).""

Am I wrong about this...? I cant think of a loading condition that  results  in a stress that is modulus dependent. In CLT there are some   inter-laminar factors for stress between plys, but that's accounted for.",AskEngineers,1645064628

Determine power of electric scooter,"My question is regarding how a electric motor controller is related to the power of the actual motor.

So I just bought an electric scooter the other day. It is a Norwegian rebrand of some Chinese scooter sometimes named Maxwheel or iScooter. Anyways, I wanted a scooter with a relatively high power since I weigh around 200 lbs and want to be able to climb hills. The one I bought was advertised with a nominal power of 500 W, with a peak of 1000W. An important factor to note is that the scooter has a maximum speed of around 13 mph in order to be legal in Norway, while the scooter is actually made to go around 19 mph. How they turn down the maximum speed I am not sure of, but I am guessing the motor controller or firmware is involved.

I received the scooter yesterday, and figured I wanted to verify the actual power of the scooter/controller. [And why was I not surprised to see a motor controller with a rated power of 350 W](https://imgur.com/a/BvB3gW9), and not the advertised 500 W. If I look at the motor it has some [numbers on it which states 36V30A](https://imgur.com/a/uD3gZsv) (equaling 1000W), but the same numbers are seen on 350W Xiaomi 365 motors on aliexpress, so I am not sure exactly what they mean.

I should add that it is possible to buy this scooter as the advertised 500W with both the nominal speed (19 mph) and the throttled speed (13 mph). They also sell a advertised 350W scooter with the both same maximum speeds as for the 500W version.

So, do you guys know if I have been hustled, or could this be as expected considering the throttled max speed of the scooter?

So we are often building things to the black and white of a spec and where it is gray we make our own judgement, to the most benefit of the company with complete disregard for the known parameters of the job.  This quite often leads to change orders where, because something wasn't black and white, the client is charged more than the original order to redo what we did, but this time with the client in mind.  The worst example to day was when I was told directly that the client was in the process of updating their specification.  So we were to make our design just barely meet that spec requirement because when the spec change is finished, the design will not meet the new requirement.  This will then lead to ANOTHER change order on this job and delay the project further.

This kind of business operation just seems sleezy to me.  I understand that the company must look out for itself and it's finances, but when this is a regular occurrence it seems unprofessional to our clients.  To do work knowing it will be redone and at a higher price simply because it was not explicitly dictated at the beginning.  There is no upfront clarification before a project starts, no client/design team meeting to discuss purpose or goals and the first notice to a client that something isn't as they imagined is the first design submittal after the engineering work has been done.",AskEngineers,1645041688

How do you prefer to be approached by a salesperson?,"I wanted to get some first-hand feedback from you folks here to see how I can do my job in the most frictionless way possible when prospecting to, you know it, engineers.

A lot of us sales guys and gals get trained up and down on how to cold prospect clientele of all kinds, but every persona is different.

Inevitably, many of you will be approached by a salesperson like myself slinging some snazzy tech product. Personally, I only work for companies that I truly believe have something amazing to offer. However, I understand that from your perspective it can seem like I'm only trying to hit a quota by any means possible, and I get that. No one wants to feel like a means to an end. I have no problem conveying value once the conversation is started, but my prospecting can always improve.

"""Do not disturb"" etiquette and ideas","I work 3-4 days a week in an open office with my coworkers (WFH the other day(s)). It's a small company, so I wear a lot of hats.

I can set my chat status to ""do not disturb"", but that doesn't stop in-person interruptions.

How to determine specs for vacuum system,"My team is building a robot that needs to use vacuum to move a load, but none of us are experts in pneumatics and we have a disagreement about the specific of the vacuum system to use. 

The vacuum cups will be parallel to the ground and move the load in that direction via linear actuators. Speed isnt a concern so this can be as slow as 10mm/s. The load itself is unknown, but we are estimating for safety that the load will be less than 5kgs.

What we need to figure out is:
1. Size of cups and number of cups
2. Vacuum pressure required at each cup, which leads to how many ejectors needed (1 per cup, 1 per 2 cups, etc)
3. Compressor needed to supply based on loss from ejectors

Additionally, we couldnt agree on how the vacuum is split if we run 2+ cups on one ejector vs one cup on one ejector. What are the physics at play here? We reached a paradox where if you increased the area indefinitely, while maintaining the flow rate, speed would decrease which would increase pressure, but we cant land on why it wouldnt increase indefinitely as well.

Lastly, where can you find breakaway force of cups? No supplier we have found actually lists it.

Advice for choosing between two strong job offers,"Hey y‚Äôall, I recently received a second job offer from one of the big tech companies as an entry level Process Engineer.

For the ChemE job they offered me $86k a year and they recruited me from job boards. The work seems interesting but I‚Äôd be traveling often as they are contractors. For the Process engineer position, I had to apply and go through about 4 interviews before getting the offer, $71k a year base and $8k in stock options. I‚Äôm negotiating rn for $76k base, $8k in stock options, and $6k signing bonus. The problem is I don‚Äôt know which job would be better for my long term career goals. 
In the long run I would like to work for Neuralink, Meta, or whatever company working with brain body interfaces and VR.

"Engineers who work/worked at design consultancies, do you like it?","I am expecting an offer soon from a design consultancy for a mechanical design engineer position. My current position is very analytical and most of my workload is dealing with vendors or wrangling documentation. I really really miss doing design work, which is what I did at my last job and what I thought I would do at this job. Supposedly we are going to start designing a whole new product later this year, but I get the sense my department will not be doing a lot of the actual design and will instead be responsible for managing the designs of outsource partners, since nobody on my team except me has really done any kind of low-level design work before.

This new position is at the type of place that my current company would outsource design work to. Same industry even. Their engineers spend the majority of their time designing machines and products and not as much time juggling vendors or dealing with supply chain stuff because, well, they ARE the vendor. The work looks far more interesting to me and would allow me to develop the skill sets I want to develop. Only thing is I have never worked for a consultancy before. The whole tracking billable hours thing sounds tedious. Part of me worries that if I ever want to go back to a large company like my current gig, I won't have enough product lifecycle experience to get back in at the level I will be at, even if my technical design knowledge will be good. I don't really know how consultancies are viewed by other companies. I can't tell if consultancies are respected, or viewed as someone to offload bullshit onto. Maybe it depends on the context and companies in question?

I don't know salary and benefits details yet, but those will obviously weigh heavily in my decision, as will the amount of WFH they let me do.

Need advice on managing multi-tasking at new job and ADHD,"I just started my new job last summer in an engineering rotational program. I graduated last spring of 2021 in mechanical engineering. One thing I noticed that makes doing well in my job really difficult is my ADHD. I struggle to manage having multiple projects going on at once and only working little by little on each of them rather than allowing myself to hyper-fixate on one or two projects at a time and really crank them out quickly. By quickly, I don't mean low quality, just that I get kinda obsessive over projects. I'm currently hyper-fixated on creating an app to allow my manager to track daily statuses of our products out on sites but I have 3 other projects I really need to get started on as well.

Data Scientist Opportunities within Biomedical Engineering Field,"**Background -** Undergrad degree in Mech. Engineering. Realized I didn't want to do that for a career and swiftly transitioned to a career in Data Science.

I've been a DS for 6 years since I graduated from college and I'm currently a Senior ML Engineer at a startup. My end goal has always been to leverage my DS skills/experience to trace back to an engineering-focused company.

I am highly interested in biomed companies that are working with artificial organs, medical imaging, exoskeletons, or prosthetics. I don't think it's wise to ""soft"" reset myself by becoming an engineer so if there's a way for me to work alongside engineers, that'd be awesome.

Does an NDA continue to exist if the company I agreed to NDA with went through partial acquisition and now my employer is officially a different company?,"\-I signed an NDA for Company B while working as a contract employee for Company C.  
\-Company B gave me a direct-hire offer that I accepted.   
\-Company A acquired a portion of Company B almost immediately after the period where I accepted direct offer from Company B.   
\-Company A only acquired SOME of Company B's offices, assets, etc. Company B **still exists**.  
\-I was transferred along with the acquisition and am now directly employed by Company A.   


As far as I can recall, no new NDA nor Non-Compete were signed. The NDA and Non-Compete I have with my signature on it all very specifically state that the NDA and Non-Compete exist with Company B. I have no memory nor any record of any new NDA or Non-Compete being presented or signed with Company A's name or information on it. The portion of Company B that was acquired also immediately changed names and is nowhere even relatively close to the company name listed on the signed NDA and Non-Compete.  


Am I contractually bound to uphold these non-compete and NDA agreements, signed in contract with Company B, now that I am an employee of Company A after Company B was only *partially* obtained through the acquisition?   


From my understanding, since Company B was not 100% bought out, and still exists - that agreement still exists with Company B... NOT with Company A. 

And that Company B could still pursue breach of the NDA and/or non-compete if they chose, since they are still a legal business operating under the same name as the one listed on the signed NDA &amp; Non-Compete. I Think the likelihood of that happening is almost 0, so that's not my concern.  


My concern is if my current company can hold me accountable to an NDA and Non-Compete I signed with an entirely different company. Again, I was in one of the offices that were bought out through a partial acquisition and thus the company I originally agreed to NDA and Non-Compete with are still legally open for business and operating in the same industry.",AskEngineers,1644976763

What kind of engineering job rewards a deep dive mentality?,"I don't think that the industry I'm in is for me and I need help figuring out what roads I might take. 

Let me preface this by saying that I recognize I have flaws, I'm a young engineer, and I'm going to need to adjust my approach. But I'm a hard worker, I am smart, I am driven, and I am great at written communication (technical or otherwise). I also understand the difference between theory and practicality. I understand the need for efficiency, and intend to be very efficient once I've had a chance to learn a subject (I become kind of encyclopedic). I've been a mechanic and a service manager. I've done school but I've also done some extracurricular design projects during my time there that were pretty awesome. I worked in quality Engineering too. I've worked in some capacity for almost 15 years. So this isn't a situation of not understanding the different mindset between school and work. I'm sure part of it is indeed ""new engineer syndrome"" but it also feels, at least in part, more fundamental.

I work in contract manufacturing where OEMs are our customers. And it seems like my way of working does not bring value. I am maybe too analytical, and too indecisive, and not fast enough. But that's because I like to delve into an issue, to understand it on a detailed level, to optimize, to anticipate what could happen, to get to the root of the matter and develop a design/test plan accordingly, to automate, to improve. I like variety, but I want depth too. Heck, I want to do more math! And in this business it feels like none of that matters. What matters is getting something out that is good enough, as cheaply and as quickly as possible. Copy and paste whatever you can. Use the familiar when you can instead of investigating another possible option. Just move forward with the fastest, simplest, cheapest idea, and if it doesn't work don't spend much time trying to find the why, just try something else.

How honest about why I might be leaving?,"I'm thinking of leaving my current EE job because I'm burned out, and I don't see it getting better. I've been here for 14 years, and I'm paid really well, like more than I dreamed. It was my first job out of school. The problem is that the job is cyclical in terms of stress, with periods of a few months once or twice a year where I'm under incredible pressure and stress to the point of crying while I drive home. I am passionate about the job, like everything I do, and I probably am deficient in how I handle workload and hold boundaries. 

I feel like the high pay is 1) rewarding me for being the guy who puts out fires and 2) an excuse to expect me to be the guy who puts out fires. In other words, I don't necessarily appreciate the high pay because of the pain it entails. I'm pegged in a role and I don't think I'll ever stop having it while I'm at this company. 

I honestly wonder sometimes if a lot of my issues at work are my own fault. I've decided that I probably have ADHD, and I'm working on getting an appointment for a diagnosis, and I also am working on getting an appointment for a therapist. I'm hoping to address some root issues in my own life in case my problems follow me to any other job I go to. 

What has changed is that the company is short staffed, and so my workload is be steadily intense for more than a year, plus some major events in my personal life (parent dying, new baby with major health issues), I'm feeling very dysfunctional at work. My productivity has tanked and I feel really guilty about it. 

I have a friend who runs a company which is in the same industry but a different type of work, and I am almost positive I will move to work for him. The job is interesting, and I can see myself as a good fit there. It's not a dream job, but I'm looking forward to trying it out. I haven't discussed pay with them, but I'd take a pay cut for a less stressful job. 

Overall, I really like my current job. I really like the people I work with. My bosses care about me and are supportive when I say what is wrong-- but things don't change enough to actually fix my problems with the job, and so I've decided this is the way it will always be.

Do prescription glasses/contacts factor into the optics calculations for multi-lens (stereo) microscopes?,"**For context** -  I am a jeweler who is looking at buying an expensive and custom order microscope, with no ability to try it out before hand. My glasses prescription is -6.5 (roughly a natural 10x magnification without glasses) with a slight astigmatism in one eye. I need to use Dremel style rotary tools between the scope head and what I am working on, so I am looking at microscopes with a larger objective (working distance). Ideally, I would want 30-60 cm (1-2 ft), or minimally ~15 cm (6 in). Final magnification would need to be ~20x.

________________



I have always struggled to get things in focus when using microscopes at work, or in science class. The main issue I have is that the working distance when I get things in focus seems to be shorter than for my former coworkers, forcing me to compromise between magnification power and working distance. I have had more success when wearing contacts, but the focus and light diffraction seems subjectively worse... However, I can't shake the feeling that I am imagining the problem and am missing something obvious.

"""Floating"" a Granite Sphere on water (Kugel Fountain)","[This is an (OC) MS paint sketch of the system I'm trying to study.](https://imgur.com/wjYeDfg) (imgur link) 

I am trying to understand the physics and math behind this. It's formally known as a [Kugel fountain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kugel_fountain). 

I am trying to learn **how to calculate the net force exerted on a hemisphere, when its curved surface is subject to a uniform pressure.** 

I know I have to integrate over some function that describes the curvature of the sphere. But I don't know how to setup the equations.

Or am I overthinking this ? 

Can I just take the area of a circle and multiply that with the water pressure to get the vertical component of the force exerted on the hemisphere? 

All the horizontal components should cancel out due to the symmetry of the hemisphere

I tried to put some real numbers to the problem. 

In my example case:

Density of granite -   2700kg /m^(3)  
Sphere Diameter - 30 cm   
Approximate weight of this sphere - 39 kg   
Approximate weight exerted \~ 400 N

Pressure of water = 1 bar =  100 kPA  
(The average home has at least 1 bar of pressure from Google)

How high would the water have to be on the sphere to balance its weight?

Company B, who provided the full direct-hire employment offer as ""Electrical Engineer 1"" had different employment tiers than Company A. Company A eventually harmonized the roles, doing away with a bunch of the roles as-defined by Company B and therefore creating consistency in roles across the board.   


Company A now has me in their system as an Entry Level Engineer (i.e. a recent graduate) which has significantly less duties than I have been held to since signing employment offer from Company B. Company A claims they cannot find the employment offer I signed with Company B but they can, however, find the email that was sent to HR acknowledging I had accepted the offer and what the details of that offer were.

Document I signed listed me as one Title w/ one set of job duties.   
Company now has me listed as a lower tier title w/ a substantially reduced set of job duties.

"How many people have ideas that they would like to bring to life, but don't know how to go about getting the resources?","Out of curiosity, I've often wondered how many big ideas (non-perpetual motion machines) are out there that engineers have dreamed up, but don't know how to go about getting the resources to make them happen. 

Are you one of them? What is the idea you can't get resources for, do you want to share? Be as specific or as obtuse as you want. If you're truly stuck though, sharing won't hurt anything. You never know maybe you'll meet someone here who can unstick you and you can take a conversation offline with them!

I'll start, I have an idea for a utility scale energy system because it requires a big system to work efficiently, however, as much as I put together thermodynamic models on it, it feels like I'm overlooking something. Since it is so enormous in scale, I have no clue how to get funding for it. I know grants exist for this stuff, and I've applied to them but they want to know commercial viability. Without a grant to do significant development work on it, it's hard to price it. Without knowing pricing and estimated lifecycle costs, it's hard to get letters of interest from utilities and its a cycle. It's not a casual endeavor, so I've been stuck for a few years. 

Anyone else have similar thoughts and ideas that they just don't know how to move forward? Perhaps if you share someone will unblock a path or make a connection for you here.",AskEngineers,1644877860

"Advice for an Environmental Engineer (Carrer Pivots in California, USA)","Hi Everyone

This one is going to be kinda long but to get straight to the questions in case anyone knows.

Question: 

		(1) If I have an accredited Environmental Engineering degree is it possible for me to eventually take the P.E. exam for Civil and Environmental Engineering?

		(2) Can I use my Environmental Engineering Degree to count as the 3-year credit that is mentioned in the California Class A General Engineering Contractors License or the Class B General Building Contractor License, or any of the 40 different categories of Class C licenses? Or would I have to start at the journeyman level?

To start off due to personal things that happened throughout college I graduated about 6 months ago with an Environmental Engineering Degree with a GPA of 2.4 (Civil was not an option at my school). Adding to it is the fact I didn't do any internships; I did work throughout college, but never in engineering-related positions. With that being said I'm aware that this, and not having passed my FE exam has basically made it impossible for me to get through any door. But alas I've continued on applying to positions that don't require an EIT license and picked up basic certifications such as HAZWOPER 40hr and OSHA-10 to improve my odds. I've also started studying for the FE exam as a way for me to try to get on track. 

I know that I should probably just focus on the end goal of getting my PE for Environmental engineering but after thinking about what I really want in life as a whole I came to a couple of conclusions, and I'm wondering how to go about it. 

First is I want to get a PE license in Civil and Environmental engineering, like others, my immediate thought was going back to school for civil but since I want to do more residential development. My question is; is it possible for me to work for 2 years in an entry-level civil engineering position, then just qualify to take the PE Civil and environmental exam because of time and school? Or is school the only option, or ...? 

Second is I'd like to get a contractor's license, preferably either the Class A General Engineering Contractors License or the Class B General Building Contractor License. With the goal of one day owning my own company and doing everything in-house (from designing it to stamping it to building it). I'm aware that school knowledge doesn't transfer to trades knowledge but I have prior experience basically working as an apprentice (Child labor lol). Meaning I know the basics of plumbing, and electrical; plus I'm also able to read and understand M.E.P. drafts. Basically, my second question is can I use my Environmental Engineering Degree to count as the 3-year credit that is mentioned in Calfornia Class A General Engineering Contractor License or Class B General Building Contractor License, or any of the 40 different categories of Class C licenses? Or would I have to start at the journeyman level?

Salary for Technical Manager (UK)?,"Hi all

I've recently (28th October 2021) joined a company that is a leading global supplier of cast-iron automotive components. I joined after submitting my Ph.D. in metallurgy &amp; advanced manufacturing technology. Which I passed (viva) back in December. 

I was initially inducted into their graduate training program. The post I initially applied for was more of a process engineer type of role. My boss at the time said it's wasn't very suitable as It was more of a hands-on job that required a lot of experience. And it wasn't the best use out of my research/scientific training. But he wanted to induct me regardless, as the company seeks trained metallurgists/scientists leading the company in the future, and possibly taking it in a new direction. 

My starting salary is ¬£32,000, which is quite a bit more than what they normally pay for their graduate program (named the Management training program). I'm currently based at our UK sight (HQ), but I'll also spend time at our China (Dalian), Mexico City, Czech Republic, Germany, and Denmark sights. All expenses paid for (including rent, when I'm outside the UK at least). 

The graduate scheme is usually 1-2 years long. But my manager told me (in a super thick Brummy accent) I have already more or less completed the graduate scheme in just 5 months. My main job was to write technical reports critically assessing our processes at the foundry. They were really happy with it apparently. I have also taken initiatives in setting up, for the first time, joint industry-to-academia research collaborations by drafting potential projects that would be conducted by MSc or Ph.D. students under my supervision. 

But now they want me to be a Technical Manager fairly soon (perhaps next month). We have a lot of managers at the firm (R&amp;D, Quality, production, etc), but not a technical one, so it's a new position. My job would be to propose R&amp;D projects to our R&amp;D manager, as well as continually assess our current technologies and methodologies. The role is a bit vague it was just briefly proposed to me. But I essentially completed my management training scheme, and am now appears ready to become a manager 

Any idea about the expected salary range? One thing to note is that the company struggled to keep their grad scheme graduates, as our other divisions (mostly China and Mexico) tend to take them away. So they'll have to pay really well to keep me in the UK! (i was gunning for our China division in Dalian)",AskEngineers,1644873782

However I am 26 years old, single so I don't have much going on here and think it might benefit me to open up my horizons.

"Old Scientific Toy/Demo, any info on it?","My gramps had a scientific toy he might have built himself.

It would hang from the ceiling, It looked a bit like pinheads scalp just blown out a bit, and instead of nails it looked like mechanical pencil graphite. I think it was hooked up to some sort of bench top power supply.

Why would manufacturers design a car so that its air vents close when the car is shut down?,"In New Zealand, a couple got locked inside their car (Mazda) and didn't know how to manually unlock the doors without the key fob. They used the key fob to unlock the doors, got in the car but didn't bring the key fob with them. When the doors were shut, they locked automatically. They spent thirteen hours in the car all night, and the car was off. I learned this car (most cars nowadays?) has its air intake go into recirculation mode (vent intake closed) when powered off. The amount of air coming into the car wasn't enough to sustain them and when they were found, they were close to death from oxygen deprivation. This incident made the news if anyone's interested. The air exchange rate in a car with its vent closed is close to zero. In India a family got trapped in their car when it was in a flood and the power locks failed, and they ended up all dying of suffocation. Why not design cars so that the intake vent remains open even if the car is off, for situations like these?",AskEngineers,1644848820
Any advice on attending a college career fair as a recruiter?,"My boss has chosen me to go with him to the career fair at the college that we both attended. It's at a school that pretty much only caters to engineering majors and is one of the biggest career fairs in the state. 

I've been before last fall but really had no idea what to even ask these kids other than ""what is your major"" and ""do you have any experience in CAD.""

But the answers to those questions are almost always ""civil"" because that is what the sign says we are looking for at our booth. and then ""not much CAD training"" which makes sense because the civil major didn't focus much on CAD when I was in school either. Hell I'm the ""CAD guy"" in my office but I barely knew anything when I got hired 6 years ago.

But I would need to start at the beginning of March if I jump ship. And I don't want to give my notice before the time elapses on my relocation benefits, which is this Wednesday. 

Here's the hitch: I know they're not going to be happy, as I've only been here a year, and I'd be leaving right as they enter into certification for their high priority product, for which I designed all of the hardware. That is, I set up their entire component library, set-up their schematics and drawing templates, did their system architecture, block diagrams, schematic captures, layout, antenna impedance matching, harmonic filtering, and performed other various testing ‚Äì all of which was executed at very fast, start-up rate speed.

"The anti- majoring in humanities/arts people, share your view here","Hey people. 
I am on the doors of college entry and i still am figuring out my major in this pressuring stressful late time. Long story short and to not get into a long rant, i am very invested into the humanities majors, arts, music, media, communication, business, etc. You could say i fell off a tree as i have absolutely no connection with any working person other than my father, i was dependent my whole life in an overly protective environment. But now, for personal circumstances i am forced to suddenly get all out independently to this world. And let me say it upfront i have zero knowledge or background or vision of any technical work experiences including all stem. By so, it is not that im not good at it, im really good. I just don't know anything outside of the confines of a classroom wall, nothing. I've been solid on a humanities major since all my life is writing, music and art but since money and employment opportunities is really important for me and i cannot afford a financial stressful situation, i am rethinking everything now. I know humanities and arts can make money and all, but we can't run from the fact that it takes effort, a type of effort other majors dont go through. 

Anyways, i want the anti-humanities people here. I wanna see your view on this. I've heard the pro-humanities a lot and i myself am a humanities person and noone can argue humanities are more connected to a human experience. but i wanna see the humanities people out there who are against majoring in humanities and how did you implement humanities into stem afterwards or perhaps undersatnding how to divide them. How did you feed that humanities person in you, and why didn't you choose the major route.

TCP/IP retransmissions and awful performance when sending lots of small packets from multiple microcontrollers,"I'm having some trouble with a system I am trying to create at work.

I have two STM32 microcontrollers running the LWIP stack connected via Ethernet to a simple unmanaged switch. This switch is then connected to a computer. Both microcontrollers are socket clients on two different ports. Microcontroller A is sending a 8 byte message at a rate of 10hz to the host computer. Microcontroller B is waiting for a 16 byte message from the host computer. The host computer is running two socket servers in entirely separate processes to act as a controller for both of these microcontrollers.

Here's the problem. Microcontroller A works fine at all times, all of the messages are correctly received by the computer. This even works fine when I increase the rate from 10hz to as high as 40hz. Microcontroller B also works fine when connected by itself, it successfully receives messages from the computer quickly. However. As soon as I connect microcontroller A, microcontroller B seems to be unable to receive packets. I initially thought this was some sort of threading issue on the computer end, but after viewing wireshark, it seems that when microcontroller A is connected, the packets to microcontroller B get stuck retransmitting a bunch of times. Sometimes they are eventually received with a delay of 10-15 seconds but most packets just get lost altogether. Here's a screenshot of wireshark showing the retransmissions: https://imgur.com/4YJWGCB ([192.168.125.13](https://192.168.125.13) is microcontroller A, [192.168.125.11](https://192.168.125.11) is microcontroller B)

What is the convention for a dimension mismatching the drawing geometry?,"Sorry for confusing title--I'm not sure how to word it!

I have a drawing that I just revised. It was a small change; I moved a countersink (on my CAD model) from a depth of 8.0 mm up to 7.6 mm. And I updated the drawing's dimension of the hole to reflect this change. However, the actual sketch geometry does not update when the CAD geometry is changed (very restrictive functionality, I know!). So, now I have a dimension that doesn't reflect the true geometric nature of my sketch. Is this a problem for the machinist? Do I need to put a note somewhere?
